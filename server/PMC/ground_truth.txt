Cells consist of various parts: the cell wall (structure and protection), cell membrane (regulates entry/exit), cytoplasm (holds organelles), nucleus (genetic info), vacuoles (storage), chloroplasts (photosynthesis), ER (protein/lipid production), Golgi body (protein packaging), mitochondria (energy), and ribosomes (protein synthesis).
The protoplasm of a cell is composed of the cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus.
The Golgi body chemically modifies substances from the ER, stores them, and packages them in vesicles for secretion out of the cell. It plays a crucial role in processing and transporting cellular materials.
Plant cells have a cell wall, chloroplasts for photosynthesis, and a large central vacuole, while animal cells lack these features and have many small vacuoles. These differences impact their structural support and nutrient storage functions.
Two key differences visible under a light microscope are: (a) plant cells have a cell wall and chloroplasts, whereas animal cells do not. (b) Plant cells possess a large central vacuole, unlike animal cells, which have smaller vacuoles.
Different cell types have varied shapes and structures tailored to their specific functions. For example, red blood cells are biconcave to enhance oxygen transport, while root hair cells are elongated to increase water absorption.
I don't know the answer.
Red blood cells deliver oxygen efficiently by lacking a nucleus, containing hemoglobin, having a biconcave shape to maximize surface area for diffusion, and being flexible to navigate narrow capillaries, ensuring optimal oxygen transport throughout the body.
The cell membrane regulates the movement of substances in and out of the cell by being selectively permeable. It allows some substances to pass while restricting others, maintaining homeostasis within the cell.
Diffusion is the movement of particles from high to low concentration across a permeable membrane. In plants and humans, the rate of diffusion is affected by concentration gradient, diffusion distance, surface area-to-volume ratio, and membrane permeability.
Diffusion is crucial for living organisms as it enables the movement of gases and nutrients across membranes, maintaining essential concentration gradients. This process supports cellular functions by facilitating efficient exchanges necessary for survival and maintaining internal homeostasis.
Cells are typically small because a higher surface area-to-volume ratio improves the efficiency of material movement across the cell membrane, which is crucial for sustaining cellular functions and survival. Larger cells face slower diffusion rates, limiting their size.
Root hair cells and epithelial cells in the small intestine are adapted for absorption by having long protrusions or folds, which increase their surface area-to-volume ratio. This adaptation enhances their efficiency in absorbing water, mineral salts, and nutrients.
Osmosis is the diffusion of water through a partially permeable membrane from an area of higher to lower water potential. In plant tissues, it causes cells to become turgid or plasmolysed, while in animal tissues, it may cause swelling or dehydration.
NEWater is crucial for Singapore as it provides up to 40% of its water needs by recycling treated water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water through reverse osmosis, ensuring a sustainable, reliable, and less import-dependent water supply.
Turgor is crucial for plant structure as it maintains cell rigidity by pressing the cell membrane against the cell wall. This pressure supports plant tissues and prevents wilting, influencing the shape and firmness of plant parts.
To show osmosis in living tissues using a potato strip, refer to Experiment 2C in the Practical Workbook. The procedure involves placing potato strips in water and sucrose solutions, observing changes in strip length due to osmotic effects.
Energy is essential for active transport because it allows substances to move against a concentration gradient, from areas of lower to higher concentration. This process is vital for various cellular functions, including nutrient uptake and ion regulation.

Marathon runners eat a lot of carbohydrates before a race because they provide essential energy needed for peak performance. Although excessive sugary foods can cause obesity, carbohydrates are crucial for fueling endurance and maintaining energy during the race.
Single sugars are basic carbohydrate units that pass through cell membranes directly. Double sugars consist of two single sugars linked together and are broken down into single sugars by enzymes, such as maltase, in the digestive system.
Testing for reducing sugars with Benedict's solution identifies their presence by observing color changes. Reducing sugars react with the solution, producing colors from green to red, indicating their concentration, which helps determine sugar levels in different food samples.
Carbohydrates in our bodies provide energy, form supporting structures, and synthesize other compounds. In plants, they form cell walls, store energy as starch, and produce nectar. They also aid in water and mineral absorption and maintain cell turgidity.
Animals with a thick layer of fat under their skin use it for insulation to reduce heat loss, which helps them survive in cold climates by maintaining body temperature and conserving energy.
The ethanol emulsion test detects fats in food by forming a white emulsion when ethanol and water mix with fat. This indicates the presence of fats, which produce a milky suspension compared to a clear solution without fats.
Proteins are sourced from animal foods like meat, milk, eggs, seafood, and plant foods such as soya beans, nuts, and grains. They function in synthesizing new cytoplasm, enzymes, hormones, and antibodies to support growth, repair, and disease defense.
Yes, The Arctic diet is rich in fats, as they are important for insulation and providing long-term energy in sub-zero temperatures.
I don't know the answer.
Enzymes are proteins that act as biological catalysts, speeding up chemical reactions by lowering activation energy. They are specific to particular reactions and remain unchanged after the reaction, enabling them to be used repeatedly.
Digestive enzymes include amylase (starch to maltose), maltase (maltose to glucose), protease (proteins to amino acids), and lipase (fats to fatty acids and glycerol). Each enzyme is specific to its substrate and has optimal temperature and pH ranges.
Enzymes are named using the 'International Union of Biochemistry (IUB) Enzyme Commission' system. Each name indicates the specific substrate the enzyme acts on, ending in 'ase' (e.g., lipase acts on lipids).
The shape of an enzyme is crucial because it allows only specific substrates to fit into its active site, forming an enzyme-substrate complex. This specificity, likened to a 'lock and key,' determines the enzyme's catalytic function.
Increasing temperature enhances enzyme activity by increasing molecular kinetic energy, thus speeding up enzyme-substrate collisions and complex formation. However, beyond the enzyme's optimum temperature (40-45Â°C), the enzyme denatures, reducing its activity.
Enzymes' activity varies with pH; deviations from their optimal pH cause denaturation, altering their shape and function. Understanding this is crucial as it impacts enzyme efficiency in biological processes, essential for maintaining proper biochemical reactions.
The experiment aims to test how pH influences enzyme activity, specifically protease. pH variations can denature enzymes, altering their shape and function. High acidity or alkalinity can decrease enzyme activity or lead to complete denaturation, impacting the enzyme's effectiveness.
Mitochondria generate energy through aerobic respiration, supporting cell functions like growth and reproduction. Chloroplasts, found only in plant cells, utilize chlorophyll to perform photosynthesis, converting sunlight into food.
The three main parts of a plant cell are the cell membrane, nucleus, and cytoplasm.
The rough endoplasmic reticulum is responsible for protein synthesis, as it has ribosomes attached to its surface. These ribosomes help synthesize proteins that are then transported to the Golgi body for secretion out of the cell.
Plant cells have a cell wall, large central vacuole, and chloroplasts, whereas animal cells lack a cell wall, have many small vacuoles, and do not contain chloroplasts. These structural differences are visible under a light microscope.
Under a light microscope, plant cells have a distinct cell wall, whereas animal cells lack this structure. Additionally, plant cells possess a large central vacuole, unlike animal cells which have smaller, temporary vacuoles.
Cells have different shapes and structures because they are specialized to perform specific functions. For example, red blood cells are biconcave to transport oxygen efficiently, while muscle cells have many mitochondria for energy.
I don't know the answer.
Red blood cells and root hair cells are adapted for their functions through increased surface area-to-volume ratios. Root hair cells have long, narrow projections for absorbing soil nutrients, while red blood cells lack a nucleus to maximize oxygen transport efficiency.
The cell membrane is partially permeable, controlling the movement of substances in and out of the cell by allowing some to pass while restricting others. This selective permeability is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis.
Diffusion is the movement of particles from a high to a low concentration area. In the case of perfume, the particles spread throughout the room due to their random motion, gradually reaching your nose as they diffuse.
A high rate of diffusion is crucial for living organisms as it facilitates the swift exchange of gases and nutrients, which is essential for survival. It ensures effective cellular function and maintains optimal internal conditions.
Cells are small to maintain a high surface area-to-volume ratio, optimizing material exchange. This size facilitates efficient absorption and waste removal, crucial for cell function. Specialized structures in cells also support specific functions, enhancing their overall efficiency.
Root hair cells and epithelial cells in the small intestine have long, narrow protrusions like root hairs and microvilli, increasing surface area for efficient nutrient absorption. Tight junctions in epithelial cells prevent leakage, ensuring substances are absorbed directly through the cells.
Osmosis is the movement of water from a high to a low water potential through a semi-permeable membrane. In plant tissues, cells swell due to their cell wall, while animal cells may burst without one.
