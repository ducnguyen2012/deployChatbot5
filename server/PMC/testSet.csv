What are some of the different parts of a cell and what do they do?," The different parts of a cell include the cell wall, cell membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, cell vacuoles, chloroplasts, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi body, mitochondria, and ribosomes. The cell wall provides structure and protection, the cell membrane regulates what enters and exits the cell, the cytoplasm holds the cell's organelles, the nucleus contains genetic information, cell vacuoles store substances, chloroplasts perform photosynthesis, the endoplasmic reticulum helps with protein and lipid production, the Golgi body modifies and packages proteins, mitochondria produce energy, and ribosomes build proteins.","['2 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 Imagining Cells as Chemical Factories All living things are made up of billions of tiny cells, just as a building is made of bricks. Cells\xa0are the building blocks of life. They are the simplest structural and functional units of\xa0life.What do you think cells do? To answer this question, you need to imagine your cells as chemical factories. Many chemical reactions occur continually inside these factories to keep you alive. For example:• A cell takes in raw materials. • Then, it processes these materials to make new molecules.• These molecules can either be used by the cell itself or transported to other parts of the\xa0body. In any factory, there are different departments that carry out different functions. A cell also has different structures that perform different roles within the cell. For example, mitochondria provide energy for cell activities, and chloroplasts carry out photosynthesis. Such division of labour increases efficiency within the system. It ensures that the cell can survive and perform its role within the body. How Did Cells Get Their Name? The term ‘cells’ was first introduced by an English scientist, Robert Hooke, in 1667.He used one of the earliest microscopes to examine thin slices of cork from the barkof a tree (Figure\xa01.1). Hooke saw closely packed little boxes with thick walls. He named the\xa0boxes ‘cells’, just like the cells in a honeycomb or a prison. In fact, Hooke only saw the walls of dead plant cells.  1.1 What Are Cells? Learning Outcomes• Identify and state the functions of the following cell structures (including organelles) of typical plant and animal cells from diagrams, light micrographs and as seen under the light\xa0microscope using prepared slides and fresh material treated with an appropriate temporary staining technique: cell wall, cell membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, cell vacuoles (large, sap-filled in plant cells, small, temporary in animal cells), chloroplasts.• Identify and state the functions of the following membrane systems and organelles from\xa0diagrams and electron micrographs: endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi body, mitochondria,\xa0ribosomes.• Compare the structure of typical animal and plant cells. Figure 1.1 Robert Hooke observed that cork is made up of tiny cells.  3 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 Figure 1.3 We may cut a cell in two different ways in order to view cell structures from different angles. This helps us to build up a three-dimensional picture of the cell.Figure 1.2 Microscopes How Can We Study the Parts of the Cell?Most cells are too small to be seen with our eyes alone. We can use light and electron microscopes to help us to see cells and their parts. Over 300 years ago, biologists like Robert Hooke and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek created their own light microscopes to study microscopic objects!• Light microscopesmagnify objects up to 1000x (spoken: one thousand times) (Figure 1.2(a)). • Electron microscopesmagnify objects to more than 200\xa0000x (spoken: two hundred thousand times)(Figure 1.2(b)).A camera can be fitted to either type of microscope to take pictures. These pictures are called micrographs.• Light micrographscan come out as colour images.• Electron micrographsare black-and-white images, but they can be artificially colourised.To get a clearer picture of how a cell is constructed, we may need to make a section of the cell at different planes (Figure 1.3).

A cellis a unit of life. It consists of a mass of living matter called protoplasm.While all the cells of your body may not look the same, they all have similar parts. Each living cell consists of living material called protoplasm(Greek: protos= first; plasm= form). Protoplasm is a complex jelly-like substance. Many chemical activities that allow the cell to survive and grow are carried out in the protoplasm.Scan the QR code to watch a clip and have a glimpse of the structures inside the cell.Biology Connect', '4 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 Figure 1.5 A generalised plant cell The protoplasm of a cell is made up of three parts: the cell membrane(also known as cell surface membrane), cytoplasmand nucleus(Figure 1.4). Cell MembraneThe cell membrane surrounds the cytoplasm of the cell. The cell membrane is made up of lipidsand proteins. It is a partially permeable membrane. This means that it allows only some substances to pass through it. Hence, the cell membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of the\xa0cell. Cell WallA plant cell also has a cell wallthat encloses the entire plant cell, surrounding the cell membrane (Figure 1.5). This cell wall is made of cellulose. It protects the cell from injury and gives the plant cell a fixed shape. The cell wall is fully permeable, so it does not control the type of substances that enter or leave the cell. The cell wall is absent in animal cells. Figure 1.4 A generalised animal cell showing some major organelles SystemsCells are highly organised biological systems with many organelles. While each organelle performs specific functions, the various organelles work as a co-ordinated system within the cell to carry out processes needed to sustain life.

Examples of lipids are fats, waxes and oils. 5 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 CytoplasmThe cytoplasm is a jelly-like substance that fills the inside of the cell and is enclosed by the cell membrane. It is the part of the protoplasm between the cell membrane and the nucleus. It is where most cell activities occur. The cytoplasm contains organelles. An organelleis a cellular structure that performs a specific job within a cell.Organelles carry out many functions in the cell. You will learn more about them in later parts of this chapter. Many organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi bodyand ribosomesare not visible under the light microscope. They can only be studied under the electron microscope. What Are the Parts of the Cytoplasm?The cytoplasm contains tiny structures called organelles (Figure 1.6). Each organelleis specialised for a particular function. Examples of these organelles are nucleus, rough endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, Golgi body, mitochondria, chloroplasts and vacuoles.  Figure 1.6 Organelles in an animal cell seen under an electron microscope NucleusThe nucleus is surrounded by a membrane called the nuclear membrane. The nucleus contains genetic information in the form of chromosomes. You will learn more about chromosomes later in this section. These are the functions of the nucleus:• It controls cell activities such as cell growth and the repair of worn-out parts.• It is essential for cell division. Cells without a nucleus, like the red blood cells of a mammal, are unable to divide.', '12 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 1.2 How Are Cells Adapted to Their\xa0Functions?Learning Outcome• Explain how the structures of specialised cells are adapted to their functions (e.g. muscle cell – many mitochondria to supply more energy, root hair cell – large surface area of cell membrane for greater absorption, red blood cell – lack of nucleus allowing it to transport more oxygen).There are many different types of cells in living organisms. These cells differ in size and shape and they perform specific functions. For example:• the human body has liver cells, nerve cells and skin cells, and• the bougainvillea plant has guard cells and root hair cells.

ABCPlant Tissue Culture ScientistPlant cells have an amazing ability to develop into an entire plant. This ability is called cellular totipotency. Plant tissue culture scientists make use of this ability to develop plants in the laboratories from plant tissue culture (Figure 1.22). This method reduces the time to produce new varieties, as compared to traditional breeding methods.Plant tissue culture has far-reaching applications, especially in agriculture. Specific breeds of plants that are resistant to diseases can now be produced in large numbers. In forestry, this technique is useful for large scale propagationof forest trees.How do you think this technique can help our environment and improve the lives of people in less developed countries?Cool Career Figure 1.22 Scientist cutting plant tissue culture in a Petri dish Word AlertPropagation:growing and planting new trees 15 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 TechConnectWe can now create chicken meat from chicken muscle cells cultured in the laboratory (Figure 1.24). Would this mean that we can produce a functioning organ in the laboratory by using cells that form the particular organ?Scientists may be able to make a three-dimensional model of an organ in the laboratory. However, many natural biological reactions taking place in an organ system cannot be reproduced in a model. Tissue engineers can now study a variety of natural biological reactions in an organ by placing the respective cells on a microchip. A simplified model for study is created in this way.These do not look anywhere near how our natural organs may look, but they are functional and they enable scientists to study the processes that take place in each organ, with almost complete control within the laboratory.Find out more about the benefits of using models to study processes in the human\xa0body. Figure 1.24 Meat cultured in the laboratory from stem cells  For many years, scientists and doctors have been injecting healthy blood stem cells into patients who suffer from leukaemia, a type of cancer of the blood. This method, known as bone marrow transplant, has been a highly effective treatment, increasing the survival rates of patients substantially.In recent years, scientists have developed several other methods of using cells to treat different diseases. These methods use a special type of cell called stem cells. Stem cells, unlike other cells in the body, are not specialised cells and thus have the ability to develop into other specialised cell types (Figure 1.25). This opens up a whole range of possibilities. Cells of different organs can be potentially grown in the laboratory and transplanted into the organs of humans. A patient's immune cells could be modified to recognise cancerous cells in the lymph nodes and destroy them. There are still a lot of challenges that scientists need to overcome. In the near future, we may be able to make use of cells to treat diseases that were once considered untreatable.

What is the difference between a plant cell and an animal cell in terms of organelles and their functions?," The main differences between plant and animal cells in terms of organelles and their functions are the presence of a cell wall and chloroplasts in plant cells, which are responsible for providing structural support and carrying out photosynthesis, respectively. Plant cells also have a large central vacuole for storing substances, while animal cells have many small vacuoles that contain water and food substances.","['10 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 Aim To examine animal cells using a light microscopeProcedure1Place a drop of methylene blue on a clean microscope slide. 2 Gently scrape the inside of your cheek with a blunt end of a clean toothpick.

There are two types of tissues: simple tissue and complex tissue. An example of simple tissue is the muscular tissue. Complex tissues contain more than one type of cells, e.g. blood (Figure\xa01.19) and xylem (Figure 1.20). An organ consists of more than one kind of tissue, all working together to perform a specific function. Examples of organs are the stomach and leaf.An organ system consists of several organs working together for a common purpose. Examples of organ systems in humans include the digestive system, circulatory system, respiratory system and transport system. In plants, examples of organ systems include the root system and the shoot system. Various systems together make up the entire body of an organism.

Cell MembraneThe cell membrane surrounds the cytoplasm of the cell. The cell membrane is made up of lipidsand proteins. It is a partially permeable membrane. This means that it allows only some substances to pass through it. Hence, the cell membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of the\xa0cell. Cell WallA plant cell also has a cell wallthat encloses the entire plant cell, surrounding the cell membrane (Figure 1.5). This cell wall is made of cellulose. It protects the cell from injury and gives the plant cell a fixed shape. The cell wall is fully permeable, so it does not control the type of substances that enter or leave the cell. The cell wall is absent in animal cells. Figure 1.4 A generalised animal cell showing some major organelles SystemsCells are highly organised biological systems with many organelles. While each organelle performs specific functions, the various organelles work as a co-ordinated system within the cell to carry out processes needed to sustain life.

It is the part of the protoplasm between the cell membrane and the nucleus. It is where most cell activities occur. The cytoplasm contains organelles. An organelleis a cellular structure that performs a specific job within a cell.Organelles carry out many functions in the cell. You will learn more about them in later parts of this chapter. Many organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi bodyand ribosomesare not visible under the light microscope. They can only be studied under the electron microscope. What Are the Parts of the Cytoplasm?The cytoplasm contains tiny structures called organelles (Figure 1.6). Each organelleis specialised for a particular function. Examples of these organelles are nucleus, rough endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, Golgi body, mitochondria, chloroplasts and vacuoles.  Figure 1.6 Organelles in an animal cell seen under an electron microscope NucleusThe nucleus is surrounded by a membrane called the nuclear membrane. The nucleus contains genetic information in the form of chromosomes. You will learn more about chromosomes later in this section. These are the functions of the nucleus:• It controls cell activities such as cell growth and the repair of worn-out parts.• It is essential for cell division.

Cells\xa0are the building blocks of life. They are the simplest structural and functional units of\xa0life.What do you think cells do? To answer this question, you need to imagine your cells as chemical factories. Many chemical reactions occur continually inside these factories to keep you alive. For example:• A cell takes in raw materials. • Then, it processes these materials to make new molecules.• These molecules can either be used by the cell itself or transported to other parts of the\xa0body. In any factory, there are different departments that carry out different functions. A cell also has different structures that perform different roles within the cell. For example, mitochondria provide energy for cell activities, and chloroplasts carry out photosynthesis. Such division of labour increases efficiency within the system. It ensures that the cell can survive and perform its role within the body. How Did Cells Get Their Name? The term ‘cells’ was first introduced by an English scientist, Robert Hooke, in 1667.He used one of the earliest microscopes to examine thin slices of cork from the barkof a tree (Figure\xa01.1). Hooke saw closely packed little boxes with thick walls. He named the\xa0boxes ‘cells’, just like the cells in a honeycomb or a prison. In fact, Hooke only saw the walls of dead plant cells.  1.1 What Are Cells? Learning Outcomes• Identify and state the functions of the following cell structures (including organelles) of typical plant and animal cells from diagrams, light micrographs and as seen under the light\xa0microscope using prepared slides and fresh material treated with an appropriate temporary staining technique: cell wall, cell membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, cell vacuoles (large, sap-filled in plant cells, small, temporary in animal cells), chloroplasts.• Identify and state the functions of the following membrane systems and organelles from\xa0diagrams and electron micrographs: endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi body, mitochondria,\xa0ribosomes.• Compare the structure of typical animal and plant cells.

This helps us to build up a three-dimensional picture of the cell.Figure 1.2 Microscopes How Can We Study the Parts of the Cell?Most cells are too small to be seen with our eyes alone. We can use light and electron microscopes to help us to see cells and their parts. Over 300 years ago, biologists like Robert Hooke and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek created their own light microscopes to study microscopic objects!• Light microscopesmagnify objects up to 1000x (spoken: one thousand times) (Figure 1.2(a)). • Electron microscopesmagnify objects to more than 200\xa0000x (spoken: two hundred thousand times)(Figure 1.2(b)).A camera can be fitted to either type of microscope to take pictures. These pictures are called micrographs.• Light micrographscan come out as colour images.• Electron micrographsare black-and-white images, but they can be artificially colourised.To get a clearer picture of how a cell is constructed, we may need to make a section of the cell at different planes (Figure 1.3).

A cellis a unit of life. It consists of a mass of living matter called protoplasm.While all the cells of your body may not look the same, they all have similar parts. Each living cell consists of living material called protoplasm(Greek: protos= first; plasm= form). Protoplasm is a complex jelly-like substance.

ABCPlant Tissue Culture ScientistPlant cells have an amazing ability to develop into an entire plant. This ability is called cellular totipotency. Plant tissue culture scientists make use of this ability to develop plants in the laboratories from plant tissue culture (Figure 1.22). This method reduces the time to produce new varieties, as compared to traditional breeding methods.Plant tissue culture has far-reaching applications, especially in agriculture. Specific breeds of plants that are resistant to diseases can now be produced in large numbers. In forestry, this technique is useful for large scale propagationof forest trees.How do you think this technique can help our environment and improve the lives of people in less developed countries?Cool Career Figure 1.22 Scientist cutting plant tissue culture in a Petri dish Word AlertPropagation:growing and planting new trees 15 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 TechConnectWe can now create chicken meat from chicken muscle cells cultured in the laboratory (Figure 1.24). Would this mean that we can produce a functioning organ in the laboratory by using cells that form the particular organ?Scientists may be able to make a three-dimensional model of an organ in the laboratory. However, many natural biological reactions taking place in an organ system cannot be reproduced in a model. Tissue engineers can now study a variety of natural biological reactions in an organ by placing the respective cells on a microchip. A simplified model for study is created in this way.These do not look anywhere near how our natural organs may look, but they are functional and they enable scientists to study the processes that take place in each organ, with almost complete control within the laboratory.Find out more about the benefits of using models to study processes in the human\xa0body. Figure 1.24 Meat cultured in the laboratory from stem cells  For many years, scientists and doctors have been injecting healthy blood stem cells into patients who suffer from leukaemia, a type of cancer of the blood. This method, known as bone marrow transplant, has been a highly effective treatment, increasing the survival rates of patients substantially.In recent years, scientists have developed several other methods of using cells to treat different diseases. These methods use a special type of cell called stem cells. Stem cells, unlike other cells in the body, are not specialised cells and thus have the ability to develop into other specialised cell types (Figure 1.25). This opens up a whole range of possibilities. Cells of different organs can be potentially grown in the laboratory and transplanted into the organs of humans. A patient's immune cells could be modified to recognise cancerous cells in the lymph nodes and destroy them. There are still a lot of challenges that scientists need to overcome. In the near future, we may be able to make use of cells to treat diseases that were once considered untreatable.

We can use light and electron microscopes to help us to see cells and their parts. Over 300 years ago, biologists like Robert Hooke and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek created their own light microscopes to study microscopic objects!• Light microscopesmagnify objects up to 1000x (spoken: one thousand times) (Figure 1.2(a)). • Electron microscopesmagnify objects to more than 200\xa0000x (spoken: two hundred thousand times)(Figure 1.2(b)).A camera can be fitted to either type of microscope to take pictures. These pictures are called micrographs.• Light micrographscan come out as colour images.• Electron micrographsare black-and-white images, but they can be artificially colourised.To get a clearer picture of how a cell is constructed, we may need to make a section of the cell at different planes (Figure 1.3).

Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances.Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells.TechConnectIn Singapore, there are five NEWater plants that supply Singapore with up to 40% of its water needs. The NEWater process involves recycling treated used water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water. One of the stages of the NEWater production process is reverse osmosis. Similar to osmosis, this process involves a partially permeable membrane. However, pressure is applied to move water molecules across the membrane in a direction that is opposite to that of osmosis.Reverse osmosis can remove toxins from water. By this method, very small particles can be removed by using an electric pump to force water under high pressure through a membrane (Figure 2.19). The membrane is partially permeable and has very tiny pores, which allow only very small molecules such as water molecules to pass through. The water is passed through the membrane several times until pure water is obtained.Why do you think NEWater is an important source of water for Singapore? Figure 2.19 Reverse osmosis water treatment systemFigure 2.18 represents graphically how water potential is associated with osmosis. Figure 2.18 Graphical representation of water potential gradient Osmosisis the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane. Similar to diffusion, the rate of osmosis can be affected by factors such as:• water potential gradient • distance over which water molecules need to move • surface area-to-volume ratio 31 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Higher Water\xa0Potential? When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell).A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall. An animal cell will swell and may even burst in a solution of higher water potential than its cytoplasm (Figure 2.21). This is because, unlike plants, it does not have a cell wall to protect it. What Happens to a Cell in a Solution of the Same Water\xa0Potential?Cells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.Figure 2.20 A plant cell in a solution with higher water potential Figure 2.21 An animal cell in a solution with higher water potentialHomeostasis, Co-ordination and ResponseThrough the processes of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, the internal environments of living organisms are kept constant to provide the optimal conditions for cells to survive.Disciplinary Idea placed in a solution of higher water potentialAs water molecules enter the cell, the vacuole increases in size and pushes the cytoplasm against the cell wall. The cell does not burst because it is protected by the inelastic cell wall. The turgidity of the cell with water is called turgor. The pressure exerted by the water in the vacuole is the turgor pressure. 4 The cell expands or swells. The cell is said to become turgid. 3 When a plant cell is placed in a solution of higher water potential, the cell sap has lower water potential than that of the solution outside the cell. 1plant cell cell sap in vacuole By osmosis, water molecules enter the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane. 2LinkHuman cells must be surrounded by fluid in relatively constant water potential. Read more about how this is done in Chapter 9.', '32 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Lower Water\xa0Potential?When a cell is placed in a solution with a lower water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (inside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (outside the cell).A plant cell will decrease in size and become limp (Figure 2.22). Placing an animal cell in a solution with lower water potential will cause it to lose water. The cell shrinks and spikes appear on the cell (Figure 2.23). This process is called crenation. An animal cell will become dehydrated and eventually die when placed in a solution with a low water potential. Figure 2.22 A plant cell in a solution with lower water potential Figure 2.23 An animal cell in a solution with lower water potential By osmosis, water molecules from the vacuole and cytoplasm leave the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane. 2 placed in a solution of lower water potential As the cell loses water, the vacuole decreases in size. The cytoplasm shrinks away from the cell wall. The shrinkage of cytoplasm and cell membrane away from the cell wall is called plasmolysis. The cell is said to be plasmolysed. A plasmolysed cell can be restored to its original state by placing it in water or in a solution with higher water potential. 4 The cell decreases in size and becomes flaccid or limp. 3 When a plant cell is immersed in a solution with lower water potential, the cell sap has a higher water potential than the solution outside the cell. 1plant cell cell sap in vacuole 33 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Figure 2.25 Cells of onion leaf epidermis (stained)Figure 2.24 Electron micrograph of stomata Figure 2.26 Effects of turgor pressure on plants Why Is Turgor Important in Plants?Turgor, or how turgid cells are, plays an important role in maintaining the shape of soft tissues in plants. The young stems and leaves of herbaceous and non-woody plants are able to remain firm and erect. This is because of the turgor pressure within their cells. When there is a high rate of water loss from the cells, they lose their turgidity and the plant wilts. The movements of certain plant parts are due to changes in turgor. For example, changes in the turgor of the guard cells cause the opening and closing of the stomata (Figure 2.24). Plasmolysis causes cells to become flaccid or limp (Figure 2.25). Cells will be killed if they remain plasmolysed for too long. Thus, it is not advisable to add too much fertiliser around the roots of plants because the soil solution will become very concentrated and water molecules will move out of the roots by\xa0osmosis. Inability of the roots to absorb water, together with continued evaporation of water from the leaves, will cause the plant to wilt. Unless sufficient water is added to dilute the soil solution, the plant will eventually die (Figure 2.26).Helpful Note Soil solution is a thin film of water that surrounds individual soil particles. It usually contains dissolved mineral salts or ions.

What is the role of the cell membrane in controlling the movement of substances in and out of the cell?, The cell membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of the cell.,"['22 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Diffusion Across a MembraneFigure 2.5 illustrates the process of diffusion through a permeable\xa0membrane. A permeable membrane allows both the solvent (water) and the solutes (the dissolved substances) to pass through it.Eventually, there will be equal concentrations of all particles on both sides of the membrane. Figure 2.5 Diffusion of potassium nitrate and copper(II) sulfate particles through a permeable membrane  Observation and Discussion1Using the concept of concentration gradient, explain why the blue colour of copper(II) sulfate gradually spreads throughout the water in the jar. 2When does diffusion stop?As you saw in Let’s Investigate 2.1, the particles of copper(II) sulfate moved from a region of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration in the surrounding water. In other words, the solute particles diffused evenly throughout the liquid to form a solution.If there is more than one substance dissolved in the same liquid, then the dissolved particles of one substance will diffuse independently of the others.As a result:• The dissolved particles of copper(II) sulfate will diffuse across the membrane to the left side of the beaker.• The dissolved particles of potassium nitrate will diffuse across the membrane to the right side of the beaker.  23 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Solutes can also diffuse, for example, in the small intestine when dissolved amino acids and glucose are absorbed by diffusion into the blood capillaries. A solute is a substance that has been dissolved in another substance.Figure 2.6 Gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide via diffusion SystemsLiving organisms rely on diffusion to facilitate the exchange of gases with the\xa0environment needed for survival.Disciplinary Idea Link How do humans carry out gas exchange? Read about it in Chapter\xa07.How do plants carry out gas exchange? Read about it in Chapter 12. Factors That Affect the Rate of Diffusion The rate of diffusion can be affected by factors such as:• concentration gradient• diffusion distance• surface area-to-volume ratioHow concentration gradient affects the rate of diffusion has been discussed on page 21.Diffusion DistanceThe time taken for a substance to move from one point to another depends on the distance between the two points. The distance through which a substance diffuses is called the diffusion distance. The shorter the diffusion distance, the less time is needed for the substance to travel, and hence the rate of diffusion is higher. In living organisms, the cell membrane is not like the membrane in Figure\xa02.6. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. For example, oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass through the cell membrane but proteins cannot. Diffusion is an important way by which oxygen and carbon dioxide move into and out of cells. Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs takes place by diffusion (Figure 2.6(a)). Plant cells such as root hair cells also take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide by diffusion (Figure 2.6(b)). In both these scenarios, the diffusion distance is short, allowing diffusion to occur at a higher rate.', '18 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of Life Section A: Multiple-choice Questions1 Which of the cell organelles is notvisible under the ordinary light microscope?Acellulose cell wallBcellulose cell wall and nucleus Cchloroplasts DGolgi body and rough endoplasmic reticulum2 Figure 1.26 shows a typical plant cell.

Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances.Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells.TechConnectIn Singapore, there are five NEWater plants that supply Singapore with up to 40% of its water needs. The NEWater process involves recycling treated used water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water. One of the stages of the NEWater production process is reverse osmosis. Similar to osmosis, this process involves a partially permeable membrane. However, pressure is applied to move water molecules across the membrane in a direction that is opposite to that of osmosis.Reverse osmosis can remove toxins from water. By this method, very small particles can be removed by using an electric pump to force water under high pressure through a membrane (Figure 2.19). The membrane is partially permeable and has very tiny pores, which allow only very small molecules such as water molecules to pass through. The water is passed through the membrane several times until pure water is obtained.Why do you think NEWater is an important source of water for Singapore? Figure 2.19 Reverse osmosis water treatment systemFigure 2.18 represents graphically how water potential is associated with osmosis. Figure 2.18 Graphical representation of water potential gradient Osmosisis the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane. Similar to diffusion, the rate of osmosis can be affected by factors such as:• water potential gradient • distance over which water molecules need to move • surface area-to-volume ratio 31 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Higher Water\xa0Potential? When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell).A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall. An animal cell will swell and may even burst in a solution of higher water potential than its cytoplasm (Figure 2.21). This is because, unlike plants, it does not have a cell wall to protect it. What Happens to a Cell in a Solution of the Same Water\xa0Potential?Cells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.Figure 2.20 A plant cell in a solution with higher water potential Figure 2.21 An animal cell in a solution with higher water potentialHomeostasis, Co-ordination and ResponseThrough the processes of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, the internal environments of living organisms are kept constant to provide the optimal conditions for cells to survive.Disciplinary Idea placed in a solution of higher water potentialAs water molecules enter the cell, the vacuole increases in size and pushes the cytoplasm against the cell wall. The cell does not burst because it is protected by the inelastic cell wall. The turgidity of the cell with water is called turgor. The pressure exerted by the water in the vacuole is the turgor pressure. 4 The cell expands or swells. The cell is said to become turgid. 3 When a plant cell is placed in a solution of higher water potential, the cell sap has lower water potential than that of the solution outside the cell. 1plant cell cell sap in vacuole By osmosis, water molecules enter the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane. 2LinkHuman cells must be surrounded by fluid in relatively constant water potential. Read more about how this is done in Chapter 9.', '4 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 Figure 1.5 A generalised plant cell The protoplasm of a cell is made up of three parts: the cell membrane(also known as cell surface membrane), cytoplasmand nucleus(Figure 1.4). Cell MembraneThe cell membrane surrounds the cytoplasm of the cell. The cell membrane is made up of lipidsand proteins. It is a partially permeable membrane. This means that it allows only some substances to pass through it. Hence, the cell membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of the\xa0cell. Cell WallA plant cell also has a cell wallthat encloses the entire plant cell, surrounding the cell membrane (Figure 1.5). This cell wall is made of cellulose. It protects the cell from injury and gives the plant cell a fixed shape. The cell wall is fully permeable, so it does not control the type of substances that enter or leave the cell. The cell wall is absent in animal cells. Figure 1.4 A generalised animal cell showing some major organelles SystemsCells are highly organised biological systems with many organelles. While each organelle performs specific functions, the various organelles work as a co-ordinated system within the cell to carry out processes needed to sustain life. Disciplinary Idea Helpful Note The terms ‘cell surface membrane’ and ‘cell membrane’ are used in this book to refer to the membrane enclosing the entire cell. Organelles inside the cell are also enclosed by their own membranes. Word AlertMitochodrion:singular for mitochondriaLipids:biological molecules that are not soluble in water. Examples of lipids are fats, waxes and oils. 5 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 CytoplasmThe cytoplasm is a jelly-like substance that fills the inside of the cell and is enclosed by the cell membrane. It is the part of the protoplasm between the cell membrane and the nucleus. It is where most cell activities occur. The cytoplasm contains organelles. An organelleis a cellular structure that performs a specific job within a cell.Organelles carry out many functions in the cell. You will learn more about them in later parts of this chapter. Many organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi bodyand ribosomesare not visible under the light microscope. They can only be studied under the electron microscope. What Are the Parts of the Cytoplasm?The cytoplasm contains tiny structures called organelles (Figure 1.6). Each organelleis specialised for a particular function. Examples of these organelles are nucleus, rough endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, Golgi body, mitochondria, chloroplasts and vacuoles.  Figure 1.6 Organelles in an animal cell seen under an electron microscope NucleusThe nucleus is surrounded by a membrane called the nuclear membrane. The nucleus contains genetic information in the form of chromosomes. You will learn more about chromosomes later in this section. These are the functions of the nucleus:• It controls cell activities such as cell growth and the repair of worn-out parts.• It is essential for cell division. Cells without a nucleus, like the red blood cells of a mammal, are unable to divide.']"
How does diffusion work and what factors affect the rate of diffusion in plants and humans?," Diffusion is the process of particles moving from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration across a permeable membrane, and it plays a role in nutrient uptake and gaseous exchange in both plants and humans. The factors that affect the rate of diffusion include the concentration gradient, surface area-to-volume ratio of the cell membrane, and the presence of a permeable membrane.","['20 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 2.1 What Is Diffusion? Learning Outcomes• Define diffusion and describe its role in nutrient uptake and gaseous exchange in plants and\xa0humans. • Describe the factors that affect the rate of diffusion. DiffusionImagine that you are sitting in the living room reading a book. Your sister accidentally spills a bottle of perfume in the living room. Gradually, you become aware of a pleasant scent spreading through the living room.Figure 2.1 illustrates how diffusion takes place. Figure 2.1 Diffusion of perfume particlesPerfume, like all matter, is made up of particles such as atoms, molecules or ions.Individual particles of perfume evaporate from the surface of the spill, that is, they become a\xa0gas.The gas particles have kinetic energy and are constantly moving in all directions. They bump into one another and move about randomly.This causes the gas to spread throughout the house, until it reaches your nose and you smell it. The gas spreads outwards through a process called diffusion.What Is a Concentration Gradient and How Is It Related to\xa0Diffusion?In Figure 2.1, point A represents the location where the bottle of perfume was spilled. Point B represents you in the living room, some distance away. Concentration refers to the amount of a substance within a fixed volume. The concentration of gas particles is higher at A than at B. Thus, there is a difference in concentration between points A and B. This concentration difference can be shown on a graph (Figure 2.2) and is referred to as the concentration gradient. 2 4 3 1 PhysicsWe learn that the random movement of microscopic particles is known as Brownian motion.Link 1 2 3 4 AB 21 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 In Figure 2.2, the height of the blue line shows the concentration at each point. If we join the concentrations at A and B, we get a straight line, which is sloped or has a gradient. This red dotted line is the concentration gradientbetween A and B.Concentration gradient is the difference in concentration between two\xa0regions.The particles of fluids (liquids and gases) possess movement (kinetic) energy. They are continuously moving about. As their movement is random, the particles will move (diffuse) down the concentration gradient and become evenly spaced out after some time (Figure 2.3). In Figure 2.1, the smell of perfume diffuses throughout the house.• Diffusion can thus be described as the net movement of particles down a concentration gradient.• Thesteeper the concentration gradient for a substance, the faster the rate of diffusion for that substance.Diffusion is the net movement of particles (atoms, molecules or ions) from\xa0a region where they are of higher concentration to a region where they are of lower concentration, that is, down a concentration gradient.ChemistryWe learn that all matter is made up of tiny particles that are in constant random motion. These moving particles have kinetic energy. Link Figure 2.2 Graphical representation of diffusion Figure 2.3 Arrows showing direction of movement of particles as they space out  Helpful Note Net movement refers to the overall movement of particles. Net movement of particles occurs when the movement of particles in one direction is greater than the movement of particles in the opposite direction.When the two regions have the same number of particles per unit volume, the movement of the particles between the two regions will be the same in both directions. Thus, there will be no net\xa0movement. AimTo investigate the diffusion of a dissolved substance in waterProcedure1Drop a copper(II) sulfate crystal into a gas jar full of water as shown in Figure 2.4.

Figure 2.5 Diffusion of potassium nitrate and copper(II) sulfate particles through a permeable membrane  Observation and Discussion1Using the concept of concentration gradient, explain why the blue colour of copper(II) sulfate gradually spreads throughout the water in the jar. 2When does diffusion stop?As you saw in Let’s Investigate 2.1, the particles of copper(II) sulfate moved from a region of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration in the surrounding water. In other words, the solute particles diffused evenly throughout the liquid to form a solution.If there is more than one substance dissolved in the same liquid, then the dissolved particles of one substance will diffuse independently of the others.As a result:• The dissolved particles of copper(II) sulfate will diffuse across the membrane to the left side of the beaker.• The dissolved particles of potassium nitrate will diffuse across the membrane to the right side of the beaker.  23 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Solutes can also diffuse, for example, in the small intestine when dissolved amino acids and glucose are absorbed by diffusion into the blood capillaries. A solute is a substance that has been dissolved in another substance.Figure 2.6 Gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide via diffusion SystemsLiving organisms rely on diffusion to facilitate the exchange of gases with the\xa0environment needed for survival.Disciplinary Idea Link How do humans carry out gas exchange?

Factors That Affect the Rate of Diffusion The rate of diffusion can be affected by factors such as:• concentration gradient• diffusion distance• surface area-to-volume ratioHow concentration gradient affects the rate of diffusion has been discussed on page 21.Diffusion DistanceThe time taken for a substance to move from one point to another depends on the distance between the two points. The distance through which a substance diffuses is called the diffusion distance. The shorter the diffusion distance, the less time is needed for the substance to travel, and hence the rate of diffusion is higher. In living organisms, the cell membrane is not like the membrane in Figure\xa02.6. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. For example, oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass through the cell membrane but proteins cannot. Diffusion is an important way by which oxygen and carbon dioxide move into and out of cells. Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs takes place by diffusion (Figure 2.6(a)). Plant cells such as root hair cells also take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide by diffusion (Figure 2.6(b)). In both these scenarios, the diffusion distance is short, allowing diffusion to occur at a higher rate.', '26 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Some cells are specifically adapted to absorb substances, for example, root hair cells and the epithelial cells, which line the small intestine (Figure 2.9). Such cells often have long narrow protrusionsor folds in their membranes. These greatly increase the surface area-to-volume ratio of the cell membrane through which materials can be absorbed into the cell.You will learn more about this in Chapter 5.

Living cells are able to absorb certain substances even though these substances are of higher concentration inside the cell than they are in the external environment. This means that the cells are absorbing substances against a concentration gradient (Figure 2.30). Such a process requires energy and is called active transport. 1Humans store food to see them through times when food is in short supply. Unfortunately, bacteria and fungi attack stored food and make it go bad. One way of preventing this is to store food in strong salt solutions (brine) or sugar solutions (syrups) (Figure 2.29). Suggest with reasons why brine or syrups are used in food preservation.2An animal cell is placed in a concentrated solution of sugar.

Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances.Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells.TechConnectIn Singapore, there are five NEWater plants that supply Singapore with up to 40% of its water needs. The NEWater process involves recycling treated used water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water. One of the stages of the NEWater production process is reverse osmosis. Similar to osmosis, this process involves a partially permeable membrane. However, pressure is applied to move water molecules across the membrane in a direction that is opposite to that of osmosis.Reverse osmosis can remove toxins from water. By this method, very small particles can be removed by using an electric pump to force water under high pressure through a membrane (Figure 2.19). The membrane is partially permeable and has very tiny pores, which allow only very small molecules such as water molecules to pass through. The water is passed through the membrane several times until pure water is obtained.Why do you think NEWater is an important source of water for Singapore? Figure 2.19 Reverse osmosis water treatment systemFigure 2.18 represents graphically how water potential is associated with osmosis. Figure 2.18 Graphical representation of water potential gradient Osmosisis the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane. Similar to diffusion, the rate of osmosis can be affected by factors such as:• water potential gradient • distance over which water molecules need to move • surface area-to-volume ratio 31 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Higher Water\xa0Potential? When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell).A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall. An animal cell will swell and may even burst in a solution of higher water potential than its cytoplasm (Figure 2.21). This is because, unlike plants, it does not have a cell wall to protect it. What Happens to a Cell in a Solution of the Same Water\xa0Potential?Cells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.Figure 2.20 A plant cell in a solution with higher water potential Figure 2.21 An animal cell in a solution with higher water potentialHomeostasis, Co-ordination and ResponseThrough the processes of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, the internal environments of living organisms are kept constant to provide the optimal conditions for cells to survive.Disciplinary Idea placed in a solution of higher water potentialAs water molecules enter the cell, the vacuole increases in size and pushes the cytoplasm against the cell wall. The cell does not burst because it is protected by the inelastic cell wall. The turgidity of the cell with water is called turgor. The pressure exerted by the water in the vacuole is the turgor pressure. 4 The cell expands or swells. The cell is said to become turgid. 3 When a plant cell is placed in a solution of higher water potential, the cell sap has lower water potential than that of the solution outside the cell. 1plant cell cell sap in vacuole By osmosis, water molecules enter the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane. 2LinkHuman cells must be surrounded by fluid in relatively constant water potential.

Why are cells typically small?," Cells are typically small in order to facilitate the efficient movement of materials across their cell membrane in order to stay alive. As cells differentiate and become more specialized, they may develop structures to assist in carrying out specific functions, which may also contribute to their smaller size.","['26 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Some cells are specifically adapted to absorb substances, for example, root hair cells and the epithelial cells, which line the small intestine (Figure 2.9). Such cells often have long narrow protrusionsor folds in their membranes. These greatly increase the surface area-to-volume ratio of the cell membrane through which materials can be absorbed into the cell.You will learn more about this in Chapter 5.

Cells\xa0are the building blocks of life. They are the simplest structural and functional units of\xa0life.What do you think cells do? To answer this question, you need to imagine your cells as chemical factories. Many chemical reactions occur continually inside these factories to keep you alive. For example:• A cell takes in raw materials. • Then, it processes these materials to make new molecules.• These molecules can either be used by the cell itself or transported to other parts of the\xa0body. In any factory, there are different departments that carry out different functions. A cell also has different structures that perform different roles within the cell. For example, mitochondria provide energy for cell activities, and chloroplasts carry out photosynthesis. Such division of labour increases efficiency within the system. It ensures that the cell can survive and perform its role within the body. How Did Cells Get Their Name? The term ‘cells’ was first introduced by an English scientist, Robert Hooke, in 1667.He used one of the earliest microscopes to examine thin slices of cork from the barkof a tree (Figure\xa01.1). Hooke saw closely packed little boxes with thick walls. He named the\xa0boxes ‘cells’, just like the cells in a honeycomb or a prison. In fact, Hooke only saw the walls of dead plant cells.  1.1 What Are Cells? Learning Outcomes• Identify and state the functions of the following cell structures (including organelles) of typical plant and animal cells from diagrams, light micrographs and as seen under the light\xa0microscope using prepared slides and fresh material treated with an appropriate temporary staining technique: cell wall, cell membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, cell vacuoles (large, sap-filled in plant cells, small, temporary in animal cells), chloroplasts.• Identify and state the functions of the following membrane systems and organelles from\xa0diagrams and electron micrographs: endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi body, mitochondria,\xa0ribosomes.• Compare the structure of typical animal and plant cells. Figure 1.1 Robert Hooke observed that cork is made up of tiny cells.  3 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 Figure 1.3 We may cut a cell in two different ways in order to view cell structures from different angles. This helps us to build up a three-dimensional picture of the cell.Figure 1.2 Microscopes How Can We Study the Parts of the Cell?Most cells are too small to be seen with our eyes alone. We can use light and electron microscopes to help us to see cells and their parts. Over 300 years ago, biologists like Robert Hooke and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek created their own light microscopes to study microscopic objects!• Light microscopesmagnify objects up to 1000x (spoken: one thousand times) (Figure 1.2(a)). • Electron microscopesmagnify objects to more than 200\xa0000x (spoken: two hundred thousand times)(Figure 1.2(b)).A camera can be fitted to either type of microscope to take pictures. These pictures are called micrographs.• Light micrographscan come out as colour images.• Electron micrographsare black-and-white images, but they can be artificially colourised.To get a clearer picture of how a cell is constructed, we may need to make a section of the cell at different planes (Figure 1.3).

A cellis a unit of life. It consists of a mass of living matter called protoplasm.While all the cells of your body may not look the same, they all have similar parts. Each living cell consists of living material called protoplasm(Greek: protos= first; plasm= form). Protoplasm is a complex jelly-like substance. Many chemical activities that allow the cell to survive and grow are carried out in the protoplasm.Scan the QR code to watch a clip and have a glimpse of the structures inside the cell.Biology Connect', '24Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Let’s Investigate 2.2Calculating Surface Area-to-volume Ratios1Consider three cubes of sides 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm respectively. We use three cubes to represent cells of different sizes.2Complete Table 2.1. Table 2.1 Surface area-to-volume ratio of three cubes representing cells of different sizesCubesides 1 cm sides 2 cmsides 3 cmSurface areaArea of one face= 1 cm × 1 cm = 1 cm2Surface area= number of faces ×area of one face= 6 × 1 cm2= 6 cm2VolumeVolume= 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm= 1 cm3Surface area-to-volume ratio6 cm2: 1 cm3 Helpful Note A cube has six square faces. To find the surface area of a cube, find the area of one face and multiply by six. From our calculations, we can observe that as the cube becomes bigger, the surface area does not increase in the same proportion as the volume. The cube of sides 1 cm has 6 cm2of surface area to 1 cm3volume. But the cube of sides 3 cm has only 2 cm2of surface area to 1 cm3volume. The largest cube has the smallest surface area-to-volume ratio. The rate of movement of substances across the largest cube is the slowest. Thus, as a cell grows, the rate of movement of substances across a cell will decrease. Surface Area-to-volume RatioWhat does surface area-to-volume ratio mean to a cell?Why are cells typically small? Why do all large organisms always have bodies made up of many small cells and not just one large cell?The answers to these questions are related to the rate at which materials move across the cell membrane. Cells need to move oxygen, nutrients and waste materials across their cell membrane fast enough to stay alive. The rate of movement of a substance across a cell membrane depends on how large the cell membrane is (i.e. the surface area of the cell). For two cells of the same volume, the one with the larger surface area allows for a higher rate of diffusion. The ratio between the surface area and volume of a cell is called surface area-to-volume ratio, and is an essential concept in biology. The greater the surface area-to-volume ratio of a cell, the higher the rate at which substances move in and out of it. The following investigation will help you better understand surface area-to-volume ratios. 25Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Let’s explore the efficiency of diffusion in three types of cells using the models in Figure 2.7.In Figure 2.7, the larger cell B has more surface area than cell A, but it has less surface area for every unit volume of protoplasm compared to A. The rate of intake of food and oxygen per unit volume is therefore slower in cell\xa0B than in cell A. The cells in root tips and shoot tips are small and actively growing. As a cell continues to grow in size, its growth slows down and stops once it reaches its optimumsize. This is because as the cell grows larger, the rate of oxygen and food intake slows down. Thus, it will not be beneficial for a cell to grow too big. Cell C with sides of 3 cmPortion Z has as an even smaller surface area per unit volume. Therefore, it gets less food and oxygen per unit time compared to Y. The whole cell C is even less active than the other two cells.Cell A with sides of 1 cmThis cell can obtain food and oxygen from all its sides.Cell B with sides of 2 cmPortion Y has the same volume of protoplasm as X. However, its surface area has been reduced by half. It can only obtain half the amount of food and oxygen per unit time compared to X. Thus, the whole cell B can only be half as active as cell A.Figure 2.7 Models to explain what surface area-to-volume ratio means to a cell of increasing size Each shaded square represents the surface area of a unit volume of protoplasm.food and oxygen in waste products out imaginary lines Word AlertOptimum:best or most favourable How do cells adapt their surface area-to-volume ratios?Consider the two shapes in Figure 2.8.

How are root hair cells and epithelial cells in the small intestine adapted for absorption of materials?," Root hair cells and epithelial cells in the small intestine are adapted for absorption of materials by having long narrow protrusions or folds in their membranes, which greatly increase the surface area-to-volume ratio, allowing for more efficient absorption. This is important for both root hair cells in plants and epithelial cells in the small intestine, as they are responsible for absorbing water and mineral salts from their respective environments.

Living cells are able to absorb certain substances even though these substances are of higher concentration inside the cell than they are in the external environment. This means that the cells are absorbing substances against a concentration gradient (Figure 2.30). Such a process requires energy and is called active transport. 1Humans store food to see them through times when food is in short supply. Unfortunately, bacteria and fungi attack stored food and make it go bad. One way of preventing this is to store food in strong salt solutions (brine) or sugar solutions (syrups) (Figure 2.29).

What is osmosis and how does it affect plant and animal tissues?, Osmosis is the diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane. It can affect plant and animal tissues as water molecules move from regions with higher water potential to regions with lower water potential.,"['30 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 How Does Osmosis Affect Living Organisms?A cell is surrounded by a living, partially permeable cell membrane. Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances.Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells.TechConnectIn Singapore, there are five NEWater plants that supply Singapore with up to 40% of its water needs. The NEWater process involves recycling treated used water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water. One of the stages of the NEWater production process is reverse osmosis. Similar to osmosis, this process involves a partially permeable membrane. However, pressure is applied to move water molecules across the membrane in a direction that is opposite to that of osmosis.Reverse osmosis can remove toxins from water. By this method, very small particles can be removed by using an electric pump to force water under high pressure through a membrane (Figure 2.19). The membrane is partially permeable and has very tiny pores, which allow only very small molecules such as water molecules to pass through. The water is passed through the membrane several times until pure water is obtained.Why do you think NEWater is an important source of water for Singapore? Figure 2.19 Reverse osmosis water treatment systemFigure 2.18 represents graphically how water potential is associated with osmosis. Figure 2.18 Graphical representation of water potential gradient Osmosisis the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane. Similar to diffusion, the rate of osmosis can be affected by factors such as:• water potential gradient • distance over which water molecules need to move • surface area-to-volume ratio 31 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Higher Water\xa0Potential? When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell).A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall. An animal cell will swell and may even burst in a solution of higher water potential than its cytoplasm (Figure 2.21). This is because, unlike plants, it does not have a cell wall to protect it. What Happens to a Cell in a Solution of the Same Water\xa0Potential?Cells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.Figure 2.20 A plant cell in a solution with higher water potential Figure 2.21 An animal cell in a solution with higher water potentialHomeostasis, Co-ordination and ResponseThrough the processes of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, the internal environments of living organisms are kept constant to provide the optimal conditions for cells to survive.Disciplinary Idea placed in a solution of higher water potentialAs water molecules enter the cell, the vacuole increases in size and pushes the cytoplasm against the cell wall. The cell does not burst because it is protected by the inelastic cell wall. The turgidity of the cell with water is called turgor. The pressure exerted by the water in the vacuole is the turgor pressure. 4 The cell expands or swells. The cell is said to become turgid. 3 When a plant cell is placed in a solution of higher water potential, the cell sap has lower water potential than that of the solution outside the cell. 1plant cell cell sap in vacuole By osmosis, water molecules enter the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane. 2LinkHuman cells must be surrounded by fluid in relatively constant water potential.

A scape (leafless flower stalk), e.g. Chinese leek, can also be used to demonstrate osmosis in living tissue. Figure 2.28(a) shows a section of a scape. A scape has two main layers of cells; the outer epidermal cells and the cortical cells. Only the outer epidermal cells are covered by a waterproof cuticle that protects the plant tissue against water loss.One cut strip is placed in water and another in concentrated sucrose solution (Figure 2.28(b)).

Placing an animal cell in a solution with lower water potential will cause it to lose water. The cell shrinks and spikes appear on the cell (Figure 2.23). This process is called crenation. An animal cell will become dehydrated and eventually die when placed in a solution with a low water potential.

The young stems and leaves of herbaceous and non-woody plants are able to remain firm and erect. This is because of the turgor pressure within their cells. When there is a high rate of water loss from the cells, they lose their turgidity and the plant wilts. The movements of certain plant parts are due to changes in turgor. For example, changes in the turgor of the guard cells cause the opening and closing of the stomata (Figure 2.24). Plasmolysis causes cells to become flaccid or limp (Figure 2.25). Cells will be killed if they remain plasmolysed for too long. Thus, it is not advisable to add too much fertiliser around the roots of plants because the soil solution will become very concentrated and water molecules will move out of the roots by\xa0osmosis. Inability of the roots to absorb water, together with continued evaporation of water from the leaves, will cause the plant to wilt. Unless sufficient water is added to dilute the soil solution, the plant will eventually die (Figure 2.26).Helpful Note Soil solution is a thin film of water that surrounds individual soil particles. It usually contains dissolved mineral salts or ions.

Link Compared to arm B, arm A contains: • More sucrose molecules per unit volume• Fewer water molecules per unit volumeAfter some time, the level of solution in arm A rises, while that in arm B falls.What do you think has happened?• Sucrose molecules cannot diffuse from arm A to B because the molecules are too big to pass through the pores of the membrane. • Water molecules move from B to A because solution B has more water molecules per unit volume than solution A. A dilute solution has more water molecules per unit volume than a concentrated solution of the same volume.Net result: Both arms A and B have the same solute concentration (same number of solute molecules per unit volume).The diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane is called osmosis. 2.2 What Is Osmosis?Learning Outcomes• Define osmosis, investigate and describe the effects of osmosis on plant and animal tissues.• Discuss the factors that affect the rate of osmosis. Figure 2.15 Experimental set-up to demonstrate osmosis OsmosisThe cell membrane is a partially permeable membrane. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. Figure 2.15 shows the two arms of a U-tube separated by a partially permeable membrane. This membrane is permeable to water molecules but not to sucrose molecules. Sucrose is cane sugar, also known as table sugar. 29 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Figure 2.17 Water potential gradient set up in the container AimTo demonstrate osmosisProcedure1Tie a knot at one end of a piece of dialysis tubing.2Half-fill a boiling tube with distilled water.3Use a pipette to half-fill the dialysis tubing with sucrose solution. Carefully rinse the outside of the dialysis tubing with distilled water if any sucrose solution is spilled.4Set up the apparatus as shown in Figure\xa02.16. Make sure the levels of the liquid inside and outside the tubing are the same. Use a paper clip to hold the dialysis tubing in place. Mark the level on the outside of the boiling tube.5Set up a second experiment in a similar way but with distilled water in both the dialysis tubing and the boiling tube. 6After 20 minutes, observe and note the level of liquid inside and outside the tubing in each experiment. Observation and Discussion1What can you say about the dialysis tubing? How do you account for your observation in step 6?2What is the purpose of the second experimental set-up? Let’s Investigate 2.4 What Is Water Potential and How Is It Related to Osmosis?• The term ‘water potential’ is always used in connection with osmosis. Water potential is a measure of the tendency of water molecules to move from one place to another. A dilute solution (solution with lower concentration of solute) would have a higher water potential than a concentrated solution. Hence, water molecules would move out of the dilute solution and into the concentrated solution through osmosis.• When a partially permeable membrane separates two solutions of different water potentials, a water potential gradient is established (Figure 2.17). Water molecules move from a region with higher water potential to a region with a lower one, that is, down a water potential gradient.

Why is NEWater an important source of water for Singapore?," NEWater is an important source of water for Singapore because it provides a sustainable and reliable supply of high-quality, clean water and reduces the country's reliance on imported water. ","['30 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 How Does Osmosis Affect Living Organisms?A cell is surrounded by a living, partially permeable cell membrane. Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances.Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells.TechConnectIn Singapore, there are five NEWater plants that supply Singapore with up to 40% of its water needs. The NEWater process involves recycling treated used water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water. One of the stages of the NEWater production process is reverse osmosis. Similar to osmosis, this process involves a partially permeable membrane. However, pressure is applied to move water molecules across the membrane in a direction that is opposite to that of osmosis.Reverse osmosis can remove toxins from water. By this method, very small particles can be removed by using an electric pump to force water under high pressure through a membrane (Figure 2.19). The membrane is partially permeable and has very tiny pores, which allow only very small molecules such as water molecules to pass through. The water is passed through the membrane several times until pure water is obtained.Why do you think NEWater is an important source of water for Singapore? Figure 2.19 Reverse osmosis water treatment systemFigure 2.18 represents graphically how water potential is associated with osmosis. Figure 2.18 Graphical representation of water potential gradient Osmosisis the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane. Similar to diffusion, the rate of osmosis can be affected by factors such as:• water potential gradient • distance over which water molecules need to move • surface area-to-volume ratio 31 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Higher Water\xa0Potential? When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell).A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall. An animal cell will swell and may even burst in a solution of higher water potential than its cytoplasm (Figure 2.21). This is because, unlike plants, it does not have a cell wall to protect it. What Happens to a Cell in a Solution of the Same Water\xa0Potential?Cells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.Figure 2.20 A plant cell in a solution with higher water potential Figure 2.21 An animal cell in a solution with higher water potentialHomeostasis, Co-ordination and ResponseThrough the processes of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, the internal environments of living organisms are kept constant to provide the optimal conditions for cells to survive.Disciplinary Idea placed in a solution of higher water potentialAs water molecules enter the cell, the vacuole increases in size and pushes the cytoplasm against the cell wall. The cell does not burst because it is protected by the inelastic cell wall. The turgidity of the cell with water is called turgor. The pressure exerted by the water in the vacuole is the turgor pressure. 4 The cell expands or swells. The cell is said to become turgid. 3 When a plant cell is placed in a solution of higher water potential, the cell sap has lower water potential than that of the solution outside the cell. 1plant cell cell sap in vacuole By osmosis, water molecules enter the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane. 2LinkHuman cells must be surrounded by fluid in relatively constant water potential.

This may include sugary foods. We know that eating too much sugary foods can cause obesity, sometimes even for people who exercise regularly. Why do you think marathon runners still eat these foods?40  41Biological MoleculesChapter 3 The Need for Food and WaterAll living organisms need food. The food we eat contains nutrients that are essential for us. Nutrients include water, carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Carbohydrates, fats and proteins are three major types of biological molecules found in living organisms. Water is an essential component of all body tissues. About 70% of our body weight is water. Hence, water is extremely important to life.CarbohydratesFigure 3.1 shows food rich in carbohydrates.Carbohydratesare organic molecules made up of the elements carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. The\xa0hydrogen and oxygen atoms are present in the ratio 2 : 1.For example:• glucose has the formula C6H12O6(ratio of hydrogen to oxygenis 12H : 6O = 2H : 1O) • sucrose (cane sugar) has the formula C12H22O11(ratio of hydrogento oxygen is 22H : 11O = 2H : 1O) 3.1 What Are Carbohydrates?Learning Outcomes• List the chemical elements that make up carbohydrates.• State that cellulose, glycogen and starch are synthesised from glucose.• State the main role of carbohydrates as an immediate source of energy in living\xa0organisms. • Describe and carry out tests for starch (using iodine in potassium iodide solution) and reducing sugars (using Benedict’s solution).

Figure 3.2 Classification of carbohydrates SugarsComplexcarbohydrates:• starch• cellulose• glycogenSingle sugars:• glucose• fructoseDouble sugars:• maltose• sucrose Carbohydrates Helpful Note Water has several important functions. It dissolves substances for chemical reactions that take place in living things. In plants, water is essential for photosynthesis, to keep cells turgid or firm, and to transport mineral salts. In humans, water helps to regulate body temperature and transport dissolved substances within the body. Drinking enough water is important for various body functions.', '42 Chapter 3 Cells and the Chemistry of Life Figure 3.3 Sugars provide us with energy to do sports. SugarsSugars are sweet and soluble in water. When dissolved in water, they will lower the water potential of the solution. Sugars provide us with energy to do work and carry out activities (Figure 3.3). Single SugarsA single sugar is the basic unit of carbohydrate. It can pass through cell membranes and be absorbed into the cells.The common single sugars are glucoseand fructose (refer to Table 3.1). They both have the same chemical formula, C6H12O6, but their atoms are arranged differently within the molecules. These different arrangements give the sugars different chemical and biological properties.Table 3.1 Occurrence of single sugars  Single SugarOccurrenceGlucose Found in plantsand animals Fructose Common in plants,but rare in animals  LinkWhat is water potential? Recall what you have learnt in Chapter 2. 43 Biological MoleculesChapter 3 Link What are enzymes? Read more about them in Chapter 4. Glucose is found in plants and animals. Fructose is common in plants but rare in animals. The structure of glucose and fructose can be represented by the diagrams shown in Figure 3.4.  Figure 3.4 Structures of glucose and fructoseDouble Sugars A double sugar is formed when two single sugars are joined together.Common double sugars are maltoseand sucrose. Maltose (malt sugar) occurs in germinating grains. Maltose consists of two glucose molecules bonded together.The equation below shows how a maltose molecule can be produced from two glucose molecules. A sucrose molecule is made up of one glucose molecule and one fructose molecule joined together.glucose + fructose sucrose The structure of sucrose can be represented in a diagram as shown inFigure 3.5.A double sugar can be split into two single sugar molecules by using an organic molecule called an enzyme. For example, when a solution of maltose is mixed with the enzyme maltase, glucose molecules are produced.

Let’s Review  Figure 2.32Figure 2.34 Figure 2.33"", '30 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 How Does Osmosis Affect Living Organisms?A cell is surrounded by a living, partially permeable cell membrane. Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances.Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells.TechConnectIn Singapore, there are five NEWater plants that supply Singapore with up to 40% of its water needs. The NEWater process involves recycling treated used water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water. One of the stages of the NEWater production process is reverse osmosis. Similar to osmosis, this process involves a partially permeable membrane. However, pressure is applied to move water molecules across the membrane in a direction that is opposite to that of osmosis.Reverse osmosis can remove toxins from water. By this method, very small particles can be removed by using an electric pump to force water under high pressure through a membrane (Figure 2.19). The membrane is partially permeable and has very tiny pores, which allow only very small molecules such as water molecules to pass through. The water is passed through the membrane several times until pure water is obtained.Why do you think NEWater is an important source of water for Singapore? Figure 2.19 Reverse osmosis water treatment systemFigure 2.18 represents graphically how water potential is associated with osmosis. Figure 2.18 Graphical representation of water potential gradient Osmosisis the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane. Similar to diffusion, the rate of osmosis can be affected by factors such as:• water potential gradient • distance over which water molecules need to move • surface area-to-volume ratio 31 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Higher Water\xa0Potential? When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell).A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall. An animal cell will swell and may even burst in a solution of higher water potential than its cytoplasm (Figure 2.21). This is because, unlike plants, it does not have a cell wall to protect it. What Happens to a Cell in a Solution of the Same Water\xa0Potential?Cells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.Figure 2.20 A plant cell in a solution with higher water potential Figure 2.21 An animal cell in a solution with higher water potentialHomeostasis, Co-ordination and ResponseThrough the processes of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, the internal environments of living organisms are kept constant to provide the optimal conditions for cells to survive.Disciplinary Idea placed in a solution of higher water potentialAs water molecules enter the cell, the vacuole increases in size and pushes the cytoplasm against the cell wall. The cell does not burst because it is protected by the inelastic cell wall. The turgidity of the cell with water is called turgor. The pressure exerted by the water in the vacuole is the turgor pressure. 4 The cell expands or swells. The cell is said to become turgid. 3 When a plant cell is placed in a solution of higher water potential, the cell sap has lower water potential than that of the solution outside the cell. 1plant cell cell sap in vacuole By osmosis, water molecules enter the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane. 2LinkHuman cells must be surrounded by fluid in relatively constant water potential.

Link Compared to arm B, arm A contains: • More sucrose molecules per unit volume• Fewer water molecules per unit volumeAfter some time, the level of solution in arm A rises, while that in arm B falls.What do you think has happened?• Sucrose molecules cannot diffuse from arm A to B because the molecules are too big to pass through the pores of the membrane. • Water molecules move from B to A because solution B has more water molecules per unit volume than solution A. A dilute solution has more water molecules per unit volume than a concentrated solution of the same volume.Net result: Both arms A and B have the same solute concentration (same number of solute molecules per unit volume).The diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane is called osmosis. 2.2 What Is Osmosis?Learning Outcomes• Define osmosis, investigate and describe the effects of osmosis on plant and animal tissues.• Discuss the factors that affect the rate of osmosis. Figure 2.15 Experimental set-up to demonstrate osmosis OsmosisThe cell membrane is a partially permeable membrane. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. Figure 2.15 shows the two arms of a U-tube separated by a partially permeable membrane. This membrane is permeable to water molecules but not to sucrose molecules. Sucrose is cane sugar, also known as table sugar. 29 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Figure 2.17 Water potential gradient set up in the container AimTo demonstrate osmosisProcedure1Tie a knot at one end of a piece of dialysis tubing.2Half-fill a boiling tube with distilled water.3Use a pipette to half-fill the dialysis tubing with sucrose solution.

Make sure the levels of the liquid inside and outside the tubing are the same. Use a paper clip to hold the dialysis tubing in place. Mark the level on the outside of the boiling tube.5Set up a second experiment in a similar way but with distilled water in both the dialysis tubing and the boiling tube. 6After 20 minutes, observe and note the level of liquid inside and outside the tubing in each experiment. Observation and Discussion1What can you say about the dialysis tubing? How do you account for your observation in step 6?2What is the purpose of the second experimental set-up? Let’s Investigate 2.4 What Is Water Potential and How Is It Related to Osmosis?• The term ‘water potential’ is always used in connection with osmosis. Water potential is a measure of the tendency of water molecules to move from one place to another. A dilute solution (solution with lower concentration of solute) would have a higher water potential than a concentrated solution. Hence, water molecules would move out of the dilute solution and into the concentrated solution through osmosis.• When a partially permeable membrane separates two solutions of different water potentials, a water potential gradient is established (Figure 2.17). Water molecules move from a region with higher water potential to a region with a lower one, that is, down a water potential gradient.

Why is energy required for active transport to occur in living cells?," Energy is required for active transport to ensure substances can be transported against a concentration gradient, which is critical for many biological processes.","['36 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Figure 2.30 Difference between active transport and diffusion Active transportis the process in which energy is used to move the particles of a substance across a membrane against its concentration gradient, that is, from a region where the particles are of lower concentration to a region where they are of higher concentration.EnergyEnergy is required during active transport to ensure that substances can be transported against a concentration gradient, which is critical for many biological processes.Disciplinary Idea 2.3 What Is Active Transport?Learning Outcome• Define active transportand discuss its importance as an energy-consuming process by which substances are transported against a concentration gradient, as in ion uptake by root hairs and uptake of glucose by cells in the villi. Living cells are able to absorb certain substances even though these substances are of higher concentration inside the cell than they are in the external environment. This means that the cells are absorbing substances against a concentration gradient (Figure 2.30). Such a process requires energy and is called active transport. 1Humans store food to see them through times when food is in short supply. Unfortunately, bacteria and fungi attack stored food and make it go bad. One way of preventing this is to store food in strong salt solutions (brine) or sugar solutions (syrups) (Figure 2.29). Suggest with reasons why brine or syrups are used in food preservation.2An animal cell is placed in a concentrated solution of sugar.

It is during respiration that energy is released, and part of this energy is used in active transport.In the human body, examples of active transport include the uptake of glucose by the microvilli of epithelial cells in the small intestine, and from the kidney tubules into the blood capillaries.In plants, root hair cells can take in mineral salts from the soil solution by diffusion or active transport, depending on the concentration of mineral salts in the soil solution (Figure 2.31).

The food we eat contains nutrients that are essential for us. Nutrients include water, carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Carbohydrates, fats and proteins are three major types of biological molecules found in living organisms. Water is an essential component of all body tissues. About 70% of our body weight is water. Hence, water is extremely important to life.CarbohydratesFigure 3.1 shows food rich in carbohydrates.Carbohydratesare organic molecules made up of the elements carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. The\xa0hydrogen and oxygen atoms are present in the ratio 2 : 1.For example:• glucose has the formula C6H12O6(ratio of hydrogen to oxygenis 12H : 6O = 2H : 1O) • sucrose (cane sugar) has the formula C12H22O11(ratio of hydrogento oxygen is 22H : 11O = 2H : 1O) 3.1 What Are Carbohydrates?Learning Outcomes• List the chemical elements that make up carbohydrates.• State that cellulose, glycogen and starch are synthesised from glucose.• State the main role of carbohydrates as an immediate source of energy in living\xa0organisms. • Describe and carry out tests for starch (using iodine in potassium iodide solution) and reducing sugars (using Benedict’s solution).

Figure 3.2 Classification of carbohydrates SugarsComplexcarbohydrates:• starch• cellulose• glycogenSingle sugars:• glucose• fructoseDouble sugars:• maltose• sucrose Carbohydrates Helpful Note Water has several important functions. It dissolves substances for chemical reactions that take place in living things. In plants, water is essential for photosynthesis, to keep cells turgid or firm, and to transport mineral salts. In humans, water helps to regulate body temperature and transport dissolved substances within the body. Drinking enough water is important for various body functions.', '42 Chapter 3 Cells and the Chemistry of Life Figure 3.3 Sugars provide us with energy to do sports. SugarsSugars are sweet and soluble in water. When dissolved in water, they will lower the water potential of the solution. Sugars provide us with energy to do work and carry out activities (Figure 3.3). Single SugarsA single sugar is the basic unit of carbohydrate. It can pass through cell membranes and be absorbed into the cells.The common single sugars are glucoseand fructose (refer to Table 3.1). They both have the same chemical formula, C6H12O6, but their atoms are arranged differently within the molecules. These different arrangements give the sugars different chemical and biological properties.Table 3.1 Occurrence of single sugars  Single SugarOccurrenceGlucose Found in plantsand animals Fructose Common in plants,but rare in animals  LinkWhat is water potential? Recall what you have learnt in Chapter 2. 43 Biological MoleculesChapter 3 Link What are enzymes? Read more about them in Chapter 4. Glucose is found in plants and animals. Fructose is common in plants but rare in animals. The structure of glucose and fructose can be represented by the diagrams shown in Figure 3.4.  Figure 3.4 Structures of glucose and fructoseDouble Sugars A double sugar is formed when two single sugars are joined together.Common double sugars are maltoseand sucrose. Maltose (malt sugar) occurs in germinating grains. Maltose consists of two glucose molecules bonded together.The equation below shows how a maltose molecule can be produced from two glucose molecules. A sucrose molecule is made up of one glucose molecule and one fructose molecule joined together.glucose + fructose sucrose The structure of sucrose can be represented in a diagram as shown inFigure 3.5.A double sugar can be split into two single sugar molecules by using an organic molecule called an enzyme. For example, when a solution of maltose is mixed with the enzyme maltase, glucose molecules are produced.  Figure 3.5 Structure of sucrose', '46 Chapter 3 Cells and the Chemistry of Life Glycogen and Starch Are Stores of Glucose Plants store glucose in the form of starch. Animals cannot make or store starch in their bodies. We get most of our carbohydrates from plants in the form of starch. In animals, the main store of glucose is glycogen. Hence, glycogen is sometimes called ‘animal starch’. In mammals, glycogen is stored mainly in the liver and the muscles (Figure 3.12).  Figure 3.12 Glycogen and starch as stores of glucose Figure 3.13 Digestion of starch Glycogen and starch are suitable as storage materials in cells because: • They are insoluble in water, so they do not change the water potential in the cells. • They are large molecules that cannot diffuse through cell membranes, so they will not be lost from the cell. • They can easily be easily broken down to glucose when needed, for example, in tissue respiration. • Their molecules have compact shapes, so they occupy less space than all the individual glucose molecules that make up a glycogen or starch molecule. Breakdown of StarchStarch in the foods we eat may be digested in our alimentary canal. When starch is digested, the bonds within the polysaccharide are broken and the glucose molecules are released.The enzyme amylase digests starch to form the sugar maltose. Amylase cannot break maltose down to glucose. Maltose is hydrolysed to glucose by another enzyme, maltase. Note that complete digestion of starch gives glucose molecules (Figure 3.13).

"What is the difference between single sugars and double sugars, and how are they broken down in the body?", Single sugars are the basic unit of carbohydrates and can pass through cell membranes. Double sugars are formed when two single sugars are joined together. They can be broken down into two single sugar molecules using an enzyme.,"['42 Chapter 3 Cells and the Chemistry of Life Figure 3.3 Sugars provide us with energy to do sports. SugarsSugars are sweet and soluble in water. When dissolved in water, they will lower the water potential of the solution. Sugars provide us with energy to do work and carry out activities (Figure 3.3). Single SugarsA single sugar is the basic unit of carbohydrate. It can pass through cell membranes and be absorbed into the cells.The common single sugars are glucoseand fructose (refer to Table 3.1). They both have the same chemical formula, C6H12O6, but their atoms are arranged differently within the molecules. These different arrangements give the sugars different chemical and biological properties.Table 3.1 Occurrence of single sugars  Single SugarOccurrenceGlucose Found in plantsand animals Fructose Common in plants,but rare in animals  LinkWhat is water potential?

The food we eat contains nutrients that are essential for us. Nutrients include water, carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Carbohydrates, fats and proteins are three major types of biological molecules found in living organisms. Water is an essential component of all body tissues. About 70% of our body weight is water. Hence, water is extremely important to life.CarbohydratesFigure 3.1 shows food rich in carbohydrates.Carbohydratesare organic molecules made up of the elements carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. The\xa0hydrogen and oxygen atoms are present in the ratio 2 : 1.For example:• glucose has the formula C6H12O6(ratio of hydrogen to oxygenis 12H : 6O = 2H : 1O) • sucrose (cane sugar) has the formula C12H22O11(ratio of hydrogento oxygen is 22H : 11O = 2H : 1O) 3.1 What Are Carbohydrates?Learning Outcomes• List the chemical elements that make up carbohydrates.• State that cellulose, glycogen and starch are synthesised from glucose.• State the main role of carbohydrates as an immediate source of energy in living\xa0organisms. • Describe and carry out tests for starch (using iodine in potassium iodide solution) and reducing sugars (using Benedict’s solution).

It dissolves substances for chemical reactions that take place in living things. In plants, water is essential for photosynthesis, to keep cells turgid or firm, and to transport mineral salts. In humans, water helps to regulate body temperature and transport dissolved substances within the body. Drinking enough water is important for various body functions.', '44 Chapter 3 Cells and the Chemistry of Life How Can We Test for Reducing Sugars?Glucose, fructose and maltose are also known as reducing sugars. Reducing sugars will produce a red precipitate when boiled with Benedict’s solution (refer to Let’s Investigate 3.1). Sucrose is a non-reducing sugar and will not give a red precipitate with this test. AimTo test for the presence of reducing sugars in different food samples using Benedict’s solution Procedure1Place 2 cm3of each food sample into a test-tube (Figure 3.6).2Add 2 cm3of Benedict’s solution to the food sample (Figure 3.7).3Shake the mixture and place the test-tube in a boiling water-bath for 2–3 minutes (Figure 3.8).4Record the colour of the solution.

Link 45 Biological MoleculesChapter 3 Complex CarbohydratesWhat Are Complex Carbohydrates? A complex carbohydrate is made up of many similar molecules of single sugar joined together to form a large molecule. Starch, glycogen and cellulose are complex carbohydrates made up of numerous glucose molecules. The glucose molecules are linked in different ways, giving rise to different structures. Hence, starch, glycogen and cellulose have different chemical and biological properties. They also have different roles as shown in Table 3.3. TechConnectFibre is found in vegetables and fruits. Fibre cannot be digested and we often find food high in fibre difficult to chew. This poses a problem for the elderly, who may not be able to chew food effectively. Enter the technology of soluble fibre supplements! Engineers have applied their knowledge of what roughage can do for our digestive system. They also understand how roughage can exist as fibres that are soluble in water. The result of this is a powdery substance that we can dissolve in water, or even mix with food or with soup and drink down (Figure 3.11). Some supplements are tasteless and odourless, which makes them highly suitable for the taste-conscious consumer. This is a good example of how engineers create a piece of technology out of what was originally a solution to a problem. The technology comes in the form of an industrial product that is available to the average consumer.

When starch is digested, the bonds within the polysaccharide are broken and the glucose molecules are released.The enzyme amylase digests starch to form the sugar maltose. Amylase cannot break maltose down to glucose. Maltose is hydrolysed to glucose by another enzyme, maltase. Note that complete digestion of starch gives glucose molecules (Figure 3.13).

Sugars provide us with energy to do work and carry out activities (Figure 3.3). Single SugarsA single sugar is the basic unit of carbohydrate. It can pass through cell membranes and be absorbed into the cells.The common single sugars are glucoseand fructose (refer to Table 3.1). They both have the same chemical formula, C6H12O6, but their atoms are arranged differently within the molecules.

Drinking enough water is important for various body functions.', '48 Chapter 3 Cells and the Chemistry of Life Have you ever put a bowl or pot of soup in the refrigerator and seen the oil on the surface harden into solids? These are oils or fats (Figure 3.15). Where do they come from, and what does the body do with them? 3.2 What Are Fats?Learning Outcomes• List the chemical elements that make up fats.• State that lipids such as fats are synthesised from glycerol and fatty acids.• State the main roles of fats for insulation and long-term storage of energy in living organisms. • Describe and carry out tests for fats (using ethanol). FatsFats are a type of lipid.Fats, like carbohydrates, are organic molecules made up of the elements carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. But unlike carbohydrates, fats contain much less oxygen in proportion to hydrogen.For example, tristearin (beef fat) has the formula C57H110O6. Note how little oxygen it contains in proportion to hydrogen. The\xa0proportions of the elements that make up fats are not fixed, so there is no general formula for\xa0fats.Fats can be animal fats or plant fats. Fats are commonly used as a storeof\xa0energy, especially by animals.Fats Can Be Broken Down into Fatty Acids and Glycerol Fats can be broken down into simpler compounds such as fatty acids and glycerol. Refer to the general equation shown in Figure 3.16.frozen oil Figure 3.15 The oil on the surface changes from liquid to solid when placed in the refrigerator. The reaction involves an enzyme. For example, when tristearin is broken down by the enzyme lipase, stearic acid and glycerol are produced: three stearic acid molecules(an example of fatty acid)lipase tristearin glycerol+Figure 3.16 A fat molecule breaks down into glycerol and fatty acid. Biological MoleculesChapter 3 49What Are the Sources of Fats?• Foods that are rich in fats include butter, cheese, fatty meat, olives, many nuts, peas, beans, seeds of castor oil and palm oil (Figure 3.17).• The meat of most fishes and ‘white meats’ have relatively less fats. However, some fishes such as herring and salmon have lots of fats. Figure 3.18 Seals and polar bears have a thick layer of fat beneath their skin, which helps reduce heat loss.What Are the Functions of Fats?How are some animals able to survive in cold climate, while others are not able to? What are the features common to these animals? How do these features help them to survive in the cold? Fats function as:• A source and a long-term storage of energy.– They are a suitable long-term storage material because fats have a higher energy value compared to carbohydrates.• An insulating material that prevents excessive heat loss. For example, animals such as seals have a thick layer of fat (blubber) beneath the skin, which helps to reduce loss of body heat (Figure 3.18).• A solvent for fat-soluble vitamins and many other vital substances such as hormones.• An essential part of cells, especially in cell membranes. • A way to reduce water loss from the skin surface. Glands in the skin secrete an oily substance.– This oily substance forms a thin layer over the skin surface, reducing the rate of evaporation of water.– The oily substance also reduces the rate of heat loss from the skin.

They are required by living organisms to carry out life\xa0processes.Disciplinary Idea Link How does the body control heat loss? Read more about it in Chapter 9.', '50 Chapter 3 Cells and the Chemistry of Life How Can We Test for Fats?The ethanol emulsion testis a test for the presence of fats. A white emulsion is formed when ethanol and water are added to fats. An emulsionis a suspension of small drops of a liquid in another liquid. AimTo test for the presence of fats in food samples using the ethanol emulsion testProcedure1On samples in liquid state (e.g. coconut oil):(a)Add 2 cm3of ethanol to a drop of liquid sample in atest-tube and shake the mixture thoroughly. (b)Add 2 cm3of water to the mixture and shake the mixture. (c)Record your observation. 2On samples in solid state (e.g. peanut):(a)Crush the solid sample into small pieces using amortar and pestle and place the pieces in a test-tube. (b)Add 2 cm3of ethanol into the test-tube and shake thoroughly.(c) Allow the solid particles to settle. Carefully decant the ethanol (pour off the top layer of ethanol) into another test-tube containing 2 cm3of water and shake the mixture. (d)Record your observation.

In the past, eggs were considered bad for our health and we were discouraged from eating more than two per week. Now, eggs are considered by some nutritionists as the “perfect food”. They are believed to contain all the necessary nutrients that are good for our growth and maintenance of the body (Figure 3.20). Eggs also contain cholesterol, which is a type of lipid.What about the discussion on cholesterol intake? Is the amount of cholesterol found in our blood determined by how much cholesterol we take in from food? Or is cholesterol manufactured by our bodies from other types of nutrients? Are all forms of cholesterol bad for\xa0our health?Our knowledge of nutrients, and the roles they play in our lives, keeps maturing as we gain a better understanding of how our bodies function. What attitudes should we embrace as we continue to explore this topic and discover more insights on food and nutrients? How should we behave when these insights from the latest research studies contradict what we thought we knew about the topic?Past toPresent Figure 3.20 Eggs contain protein, healthy fats and many nutrients like vitamins A, D and E, iron and folate.Practical WorkbookExperiment 3A Link Figure 3.19 A whiteemulsion formed indicates the presence of fats.

An amino acidis made up of an amino group (–NH2), an\xa0acidic group (–COOH) and a side chain (denoted by R, which may sometimes contain sulfur).

Vegetarians are people who choose not to eat meat. Instead of consuming meat as a source of protein, they eat a lot more dairy (milk-based) or soy\xa0products. This is because proteins are essential nutrients and so alternative sources of protein must be consumed to ensure a healthy and balanced diet.ProteinsProteinsare organic molecules made up of the elements carbon,\xa0hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. Another element, sulfur, may also be present.Proteins are always present in all cells. Their molecules are the largest and most complicated of all the food substances. Proteins are commonly found in the meat of animals (Figure 3.21). Figure 3.21 Fish meat contains proteins. There are 20 different naturally occurring amino acids, for example, methionine and valine. They differ because of their different R groups. Amino acids are combined in various ways to form millions of different protein molecules, just as the 26 letters of the alphabet can be used to form\xa0a very large number of words.']"

What are enzymes and how do they help speed up chemical reactions in living organisms?," Enzymes are proteins that act as biological catalysts and help to speed up chemical reactions in living organisms by lowering the activation energy needed for the reaction to occur. They are highly specific in their action, catalyzing only a particular type of reaction. Enzymes are essential for digestion, metabolism, photosynthesis, and respiration in living organisms. ","['58 Chapter 4 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeEnzymesChapter 4 4.1 What Are Enzymes?Learning Outcome• Describe enzymes as biological catalysts, which are made of proteins and are involved in all metabolic reactions. Biological CatalystsBiological catalysts are large biological molecules called enzymes. Most enzymes are found in living organisms.For example, potassium chlorate(VII) naturally breaks down (decomposes) to water and oxygen. This reaction occurs very slowly and at a high temperature.potassium chlorate(VII) potassium chloride +oxygenWhen potassium chlorate(VII) is heated strongly in a test-tube, oxygen is given off. Gentle\xa0heating only melts the potassium chlorate(VII), and no oxygen is produced.If a little manganese(IV) oxide is added to the melted substance, the reaction is speeded up and oxygen is rapidly given off. Manganese(IV) oxide: • allows the reaction to be carried out at a lower temperature; and • speeds up the reaction. At the end of the reaction, the same mass of manganese(IV) oxide remains, showing that it has not been changed in the reaction. Manganese(IV) oxide is an inorganic catalyst(Figure 4.1). Inorganic catalysts are not destroyed by boilingor by changes in the pH of the solution. In the same way, complex apparatus and high temperatures are required to break down carbohydrates, fats or proteins in the laboratory. However, cells can carry out these same reactions quite rapidly without having to raise the body temperature. Cells carry out\xa0these reactions using catalysts called enzymes. Enzymes Are Biological Catalysts Enzymes are made up of protein molecules that are folded to take on three-dimensional globular shapes.strong heat A catalystis a substance that can speed up a chemical reaction, without itself being chemically changed at the end of the reaction. Enzymesare proteins that function as biological catalysts. They catalyse or speed up the rate of chemical reactions. They remain chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction.Figure 4.1 Manganese(IV) oxide is an inorganic catalyst. LinkWhat are proteins? Recall what you have learnt in Chapter 3. 59 Chapter 4 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeEnzymesChapter 4 Figure 4.3 Activation energy for an enzyme-catalysed reactionEnzymes Lower Activation Energy Fat in a peanut seed can be broken down by oxidation into carbon dioxide and water. This reaction can take place when the peanut is burnt. In other words, energy in the form of heat must be supplied to start breaking down the fat in the peanut seed. The energy needed to start a chemical reaction is called activation energy (Figure 4.2). Enzymes provide an alternative pathway with lower activation energy required to start a chemical reaction. They lower the ‘height’ of the ‘hill’. This is shown in the graph in Figure 4.3. Enzymes catalyse chemical reactions. They speed up the rate of chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy.For example, enzymes speed up the breakdown of glucose to carbon dioxide and water (Figure 4.3) at body temperature (37 °C).ChemistryWe learn the effects of catalysts on the rate of reactions. Catalysts provide pathways with lower activation energies that increase rate of reactions. Enzymes are biological catalysts.

Enzymes speed up a chemical reaction by lowering the activation energy needed to start the reaction.Enzymes Are Specific in Action\xa0Enzymes have active sites. Only substrates with a shape complementary to the active site can fit into the enzymes. When an enzyme binds to its substrate, it forms an enzyme–substrate complex. However, high temperature, acids and alkalis can affect the shape of an enzyme and consequently its function.Enzymes Are Required in Minute Amounts and RemainUnchanged at the End of ReactionsEnzymes are very efficient molecules. Since they remain unchanged in the reactions they catalyse, the same enzyme molecules can be used over and over again. Thus, a small amount of an enzyme can catalyse the reaction for a large amount of substrate. For example, just a spoonful of washing powder containing enzymes is enough to wash a large load of clothing. Enzymes Are Affected by TemperatureFigure 4.10 shows the effect of temperature on the rate of enzyme reaction. Figure 4.10 Effect of temperature on the rate of enzyme reaction  Word AlertOptimum:most favourable  An enzyme is less active at low temperatures.At low temperature, the kinetic energy of molecules is low. Enzyme and substrate molecules move slowly. The rate of the substrate molecules colliding with the enzyme is very low. 1As the temperature increases, the rate of enzyme reaction increases.Increasing the temperature increases the kinetic energy of molecules. The rate of effective collision (i.e. the rate of substrate molecules colliding and fitting into the active site of the enzyme) is increased. This increases the rate of enzyme-substrate complex formation. 2This is the optimum temperature, where the enzymeis most active. For most human enzymes, the optimumtemperature is about 40–45 °C. 367 Chapter 4 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeEnzymesChapter 4 Increasing the temperature above the optimum causes a rapid decrease in the rate of enzyme reaction. The active site of the enzyme molecule begins to lose its original shape and is no longer complementary to the shape of substrate molecules.  4At this temperature all the enzyme molecules have been\xa0denatured. Most enzymes are denatured. 5 Denaturation results in the loss or alteration of the enzyme’s active site(Figure 4.11). The substrate can no longer fit into the enzyme’s active site, and no reaction will occur. Hence, when an enzyme is denatured, it can no longer act as a catalyst. Denaturation is the change in the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme or any other soluble protein, caused by heat or chemicals such as acids or alkalis. Figure 4.11 At temperatures above optimum, some enzymes are denatured. Enzymes lose their active sites when they are\xa0denatured.

Return the test-tubes to their respective water baths.5 After 1 minute, remove one drop from each solution with a dropping pipette and put it in the well in the plate provided. Then test it with a drop of iodine solution. (The solution turns blue-black if starch is present.)6 Continue step 5 at 1-minute intervals until the iodine solution remains brown.

In Figure 4.13, point Mindicates maximum activity of amylase at a pH of about 7 (optimum pH). As the solution becomes acidic (from pH 7 to 5) or alkaline (from pH 7 to 9), its activity decreases.

In some instances, the vaccines need to be stored at temperatures as low as –70 °C. At this very low temperature, enzymatic reactions that could break down the mRNA (a type of genetic material) in the vaccine are literally frozen to a halt.

Biological CatalystsBiological catalysts are large biological molecules called enzymes. Most enzymes are found in living organisms.For example, potassium chlorate(VII) naturally breaks down (decomposes) to water and oxygen. This reaction occurs very slowly and at a high temperature.potassium chlorate(VII) potassium chloride +oxygenWhen potassium chlorate(VII) is heated strongly in a test-tube, oxygen is given off. Gentle\xa0heating only melts the potassium chlorate(VII), and no oxygen is produced.If a little manganese(IV) oxide is added to the melted substance, the reaction is speeded up and oxygen is rapidly given off. Manganese(IV) oxide: • allows the reaction to be carried out at a lower temperature; and • speeds up the reaction. At the end of the reaction, the same mass of manganese(IV) oxide remains, showing that it has not been changed in the reaction. Manganese(IV) oxide is an inorganic catalyst(Figure 4.1). Inorganic catalysts are not destroyed by boilingor by changes in the pH of the solution. In the same way, complex apparatus and high temperatures are required to break down carbohydrates, fats or proteins in the laboratory. However, cells can carry out these same reactions quite rapidly without having to raise the body temperature. Cells carry out\xa0these reactions using catalysts called enzymes. Enzymes Are Biological Catalysts Enzymes are made up of protein molecules that are folded to take on three-dimensional globular shapes.strong heat A catalystis a substance that can speed up a chemical reaction, without itself being chemically changed at the end of the reaction. Enzymesare proteins that function as biological catalysts. They catalyse or speed up the rate of chemical reactions. They remain chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction.Figure 4.1 Manganese(IV) oxide is an inorganic catalyst. LinkWhat are proteins? Recall what you have learnt in Chapter 3. 59 Chapter 4 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeEnzymesChapter 4 Figure 4.3 Activation energy for an enzyme-catalysed reactionEnzymes Lower Activation Energy Fat in a peanut seed can be broken down by oxidation into carbon dioxide and water. This reaction can take place when the peanut is burnt. In other words, energy in the form of heat must be supplied to start breaking down the fat in the peanut seed. The energy needed to start a chemical reaction is called activation energy (Figure 4.2). Enzymes provide an alternative pathway with lower activation energy required to start a chemical reaction. They lower the ‘height’ of the ‘hill’. This is shown in the graph in Figure 4.3. Enzymes catalyse chemical reactions. They speed up the rate of chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy.For example, enzymes speed up the breakdown of glucose to carbon dioxide and water (Figure 4.3) at body temperature (37 °C).ChemistryWe learn the effects of catalysts on the rate of reactions. Catalysts provide pathways with lower activation energies that increase rate of reactions. Enzymes are biological catalysts.

The substrate is converted to the products.Only the substrate with a 3-D shape complementaryto that of the active site can fit into the enzyme.

However, high temperature, acids and alkalis can affect the shape of an enzyme and consequently its function.Enzymes Are Required in Minute Amounts and RemainUnchanged at the End of ReactionsEnzymes are very efficient molecules. Since they remain unchanged in the reactions they catalyse, the same enzyme molecules can be used over and over again. Thus, a small amount of an enzyme can catalyse the reaction for a large amount of substrate. For example, just a spoonful of washing powder containing enzymes is enough to wash a large load of clothing. Enzymes Are Affected by TemperatureFigure 4.10 shows the effect of temperature on the rate of enzyme reaction. Figure 4.10 Effect of temperature on the rate of enzyme reaction  Word AlertOptimum:most favourable  An enzyme is less active at low temperatures.At low temperature, the kinetic energy of molecules is low. Enzyme and substrate molecules move slowly. The rate of the substrate molecules colliding with the enzyme is very low. 1As the temperature increases, the rate of enzyme reaction increases.Increasing the temperature increases the kinetic energy of molecules. The rate of effective collision (i.e. the rate of substrate molecules colliding and fitting into the active site of the enzyme) is increased. This increases the rate of enzyme-substrate complex formation. 2This is the optimum temperature, where the enzymeis most active. For most human enzymes, the optimumtemperature is about 40–45 °C. 367 Chapter 4 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeEnzymesChapter 4 Increasing the temperature above the optimum causes a rapid decrease in the rate of enzyme reaction. The active site of the enzyme molecule begins to lose its original shape and is no longer complementary to the shape of substrate molecules.  4At this temperature all the enzyme molecules have been\xa0denatured. Most enzymes are denatured. 5 Denaturation results in the loss or alteration of the enzyme’s active site(Figure 4.11). The substrate can no longer fit into the enzyme’s active site, and no reaction will occur. Hence, when an enzyme is denatured, it can no longer act as a catalyst. Denaturation is the change in the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme or any other soluble protein, caused by heat or chemicals such as acids or alkalis. Figure 4.11 At temperatures above optimum, some enzymes are denatured. Enzymes lose their active sites when they are\xa0denatured.

Scientists and engineers thus need to design, construct and use special freezers that have the ability to maintain such sub-arctic temperatures.

Previously, enzymes were simply named by the persons who discovered them. For example, pepsin (a type of protease) was discovered and named by a scientist, Theodor Schwann(Figure 4.6), who was studying digestive processes. ‘Pepsin’means ‘to digest’ in Greek. However, naming enzymes this way led to a lot of confusion. Nowadays, enzymes are named according to a scientific system.

Figure 4.7 Enzyme-based biological detergent How Does an Enzyme Work?Enzymes are highly specific in their action. For example, amylases only act on starch, and not on proteins or fats. Similarly, proteases act only on proteins, and lipases only on fats. This enzyme specificity means that each chemical reaction inside a cell is catalysed by a unique enzyme.']"
How does temperature affect the rate of enzyme reactions?," Increasing the temperature increases the rate of enzyme reactions by increasing the kinetic energy of molecules and the rate of substrate molecule collisions and enzyme-substrate complex formation. However, beyond the optimum temperature of about 40-45 °C, the rate of enzyme reaction decreases due to denaturation of the enzyme molecules. Enzymes are also affected by pH, with an optimum pH of around 7, and can only catalyze reactions with substrates that have a complementary 3-D shape to their active site. Inorganic catalysts, such as manganese(IV) oxide, are not affected by changes in temperature or pH, unlike organic catalysts.","['66 Chapter 4 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeEnzymesChapter 4 Characteristics of EnzymesEnzymes Speed Up Chemical ReactionsEnzymes alter the rates of chemical reactions that occur in a cell.

For example, protein is the substrate on which a protease acts. According to the ‘lock-and-key’ hypothesis, enzyme reactions depend on the presence of active sites (Figure 4.8). Active sites are grooves (depressions) or ‘pockets’ on the surface of an enzyme molecule into which the substrate molecule(s) with the matching shape can fit — just like a lock and key.

Biological CatalystsBiological catalysts are large biological molecules called enzymes. Most enzymes are found in living organisms.For example, potassium chlorate(VII) naturally breaks down (decomposes) to water and oxygen. This reaction occurs very slowly and at a high temperature.potassium chlorate(VII) potassium chloride +oxygenWhen potassium chlorate(VII) is heated strongly in a test-tube, oxygen is given off. Gentle\xa0heating only melts the potassium chlorate(VII), and no oxygen is produced.If a little manganese(IV) oxide is added to the melted substance, the reaction is speeded up and oxygen is rapidly given off. Manganese(IV) oxide: • allows the reaction to be carried out at a lower temperature; and • speeds up the reaction. At the end of the reaction, the same mass of manganese(IV) oxide remains, showing that it has not been changed in the reaction. Manganese(IV) oxide is an inorganic catalyst(Figure 4.1). Inorganic catalysts are not destroyed by boilingor by changes in the pH of the solution. In the same way, complex apparatus and high temperatures are required to break down carbohydrates, fats or proteins in the laboratory. However, cells can carry out these same reactions quite rapidly without having to raise the body temperature. Cells carry out\xa0these reactions using catalysts called enzymes. Enzymes Are Biological Catalysts Enzymes are made up of protein molecules that are folded to take on three-dimensional globular shapes.strong heat A catalystis a substance that can speed up a chemical reaction, without itself being chemically changed at the end of the reaction. Enzymesare proteins that function as biological catalysts. They catalyse or speed up the rate of chemical reactions. They remain chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction.Figure 4.1 Manganese(IV) oxide is an inorganic catalyst. LinkWhat are proteins?

This reaction can take place when the peanut is burnt. In other words, energy in the form of heat must be supplied to start breaking down the fat in the peanut seed. The energy needed to start a chemical reaction is called activation energy (Figure 4.2). Enzymes provide an alternative pathway with lower activation energy required to start a chemical reaction. They lower the ‘height’ of the ‘hill’. This is shown in the graph in Figure 4.3. Enzymes catalyse chemical reactions. They speed up the rate of chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy.For example, enzymes speed up the breakdown of glucose to carbon dioxide and water (Figure 4.3) at body temperature (37 °C).ChemistryWe learn the effects of catalysts on the rate of reactions. Catalysts provide pathways with lower activation energies that increase rate of reactions. Enzymes are biological catalysts.

The active site of the enzyme molecule begins to lose its original shape and is no longer complementary to the shape of substrate molecules.  4At this temperature all the enzyme molecules have been\xa0denatured. Most enzymes are denatured. 5 Denaturation results in the loss or alteration of the enzyme’s active site(Figure 4.11). The substrate can no longer fit into the enzyme’s active site, and no reaction will occur. Hence, when an enzyme is denatured, it can no longer act as a catalyst. Denaturation is the change in the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme or any other soluble protein, caused by heat or chemicals such as acids or alkalis. Figure 4.11 At temperatures above optimum, some enzymes are denatured. Enzymes lose their active sites when they are\xa0denatured.

The\xa0‘lock-and-key’ hypothesis explains how the shape of an enzyme\xa0affects\xa0the way it functions. ‘Lock-and-key’ Hypothesis The substances on which enzymes act are called substrates. For example, protein is the substrate on which a protease acts. According to the ‘lock-and-key’ hypothesis, enzyme reactions depend on the presence of active sites (Figure 4.8). Active sites are grooves (depressions) or ‘pockets’ on the surface of an enzyme molecule into which the substrate molecule(s) with the matching shape can fit — just like a lock and key. The enzyme is the lock, and the substrate is the\xa0key.  When the substrate binds to the active site of the enzyme, anenzyme–substrate complex is formed. It is a temporary molecule formed when substrates bind to the enzyme. Reactions take place at the active site to convert the substrate molecule(s) into product molecule(s). The product molecule(s) separate(s) from the enzyme. The enzyme molecule remains unchanged and is free to combine again with more substrate molecules. The general equation is: E + S ES E + P where E= enzymeS= substrate(s)P= product(s). Figure 4.8 Three-dimensional model of enzyme pepsin with its active siteactive site (groove on the protein)Structure and FunctionThe structure of biological molecules affects their functions. For example, the structure of enzymes affects the substrates that can fit into the active site. This affects the reactions they catalyse.Disciplinary Idea 65 Chapter 4 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeEnzymesChapter 4 Word AlertComplementary:matching An enzyme has a specific three-dimensional (3-D) shape. It has a depression called the active site. The substance on which the enzyme acts is called the substrate. Later, the products leave the active site. The enzyme remains unchanged. It can catalyse another reaction.While the substrate is attached to the active site, a chemical reaction occurs. The substrate is converted to the products.Only the substrate with a 3-D shape complementaryto that of the active site can fit into the enzyme. This results in the formation of an enzyme–substrate complex. The enzyme is just like a lock and the substrate a key. The substrate fits into the enzyme just like a key fits into a lock. This is called the ‘lock-and-key’ hypothesis. 1 3 4  Figure 4.9 The mode of action of an enzyme The specific nature of an enzyme for its substrate is described in Figure 4.9. 2 Substrate entering active site of enzyme Substrate binds to active site of enzyme Chemical reaction occurs while substrate is attached to the enzyme Products leaving active site of enzyme']"

Some work best in acidic solutions (for example, protease in the stomach), others require alkaline solutions (for example, intestinal enzymes). When enzymes are placed in pH conditions that vary from the optimum, they start to denature. Extreme changes in the acidity or alkalinity of the solutions denature the enzymes. In Figure 4.13, point Mindicates maximum activity of amylase at a pH of about 7 (optimum pH). As the solution becomes acidic (from pH 7 to 5) or alkaline (from pH 7 to 9), its activity decreases. At pH 4 or above pH 9, the enzyme is completely denatured.Structure and FunctionEnzymes are proteins, and hence are affected by all the conditions that affect proteins, such as temperature and pH.

In some instances, the vaccines need to be stored at temperatures as low as –70 °C. At this very low temperature, enzymatic reactions that could break down the mRNA (a type of genetic material) in the vaccine are literally frozen to a halt. Scientists and engineers thus need to design, construct and use special freezers that have the ability to maintain such sub-arctic temperatures. They also need to design and construct containers that can store and transport large quantities of the vaccines across the world, from the place where it is manufactured to reach different countries.These special freezers and containers are examples of technology in action. Engineers apply their knowledge in cooling systems to design and build machines that work to prevent enzymatic reactions on the vaccine ingredients during storage and transport (Figure 4.14).

A B C"", '66 Chapter 4 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeEnzymesChapter 4 Characteristics of EnzymesEnzymes Speed Up Chemical ReactionsEnzymes alter the rates of chemical reactions that occur in a cell. Enzymes speed up a chemical reaction by lowering the activation energy needed to start the reaction.Enzymes Are Specific in Action\xa0Enzymes have active sites. Only substrates with a shape complementary to the active site can fit into the enzymes. When an enzyme binds to its substrate, it forms an enzyme–substrate complex. However, high temperature, acids and alkalis can affect the shape of an enzyme and consequently its function.Enzymes Are Required in Minute Amounts and RemainUnchanged at the End of ReactionsEnzymes are very efficient molecules. Since they remain unchanged in the reactions they catalyse, the same enzyme molecules can be used over and over again. Thus, a small amount of an enzyme can catalyse the reaction for a large amount of substrate. For example, just a spoonful of washing powder containing enzymes is enough to wash a large load of clothing. Enzymes Are Affected by TemperatureFigure 4.10 shows the effect of temperature on the rate of enzyme reaction. Figure 4.10 Effect of temperature on the rate of enzyme reaction  Word AlertOptimum:most favourable  An enzyme is less active at low temperatures.At low temperature, the kinetic energy of molecules is low. Enzyme and substrate molecules move slowly. The rate of the substrate molecules colliding with the enzyme is very low. 1As the temperature increases, the rate of enzyme reaction increases.Increasing the temperature increases the kinetic energy of molecules. The rate of effective collision (i.e. the rate of substrate molecules colliding and fitting into the active site of the enzyme) is increased. This increases the rate of enzyme-substrate complex formation. 2This is the optimum temperature, where the enzymeis most active. For most human enzymes, the optimumtemperature is about 40–45 °C. 367 Chapter 4 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeEnzymesChapter 4 Increasing the temperature above the optimum causes a rapid decrease in the rate of enzyme reaction. The active site of the enzyme molecule begins to lose its original shape and is no longer complementary to the shape of substrate molecules.  4At this temperature all the enzyme molecules have been\xa0denatured. Most enzymes are denatured. 5 Denaturation results in the loss or alteration of the enzyme’s active site(Figure 4.11). The substrate can no longer fit into the enzyme’s active site, and no reaction will occur. Hence, when an enzyme is denatured, it can no longer act as a catalyst. Denaturation is the change in the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme or any other soluble protein, caused by heat or chemicals such as acids or alkalis.

Previously, enzymes were simply named by the persons who discovered them. For example, pepsin (a type of protease) was discovered and named by a scientist, Theodor Schwann(Figure 4.6), who was studying digestive processes. ‘Pepsin’means ‘to digest’ in Greek. However, naming enzymes this way led to a lot of confusion. Nowadays, enzymes are named according to a scientific system. The name of each enzyme: • shows the substance on which the enzyme acts• ends in ‘ase’For example, lipase refers to an enzyme that acts on\xa0lipids. How Are Enzymes Classified?Enzymes are classified according to the chemical reactions they catalyse. For example:• carbohydrases are enzymes that digest carbohydrates• proteasesare enzymes that digest proteins• lipases are enzymesthat digest fats (lipids) 1 (a) What is an enzyme?

However, if you are using a biological washing detergent (Figure\xa04.7), which contains enzymes, it is recommended that you use lukewarm water instead of hot water. Why is this so? It is related to the nature of enzymes and how they function. 4.2 What Are theCharacteristics of\xa0Enzymes?Learning Outcomes• Explain the mode of action of enzymes in terms of an active site, enzyme–substrate complex, lowering of activation energy and enzyme specificity using the ‘lock-and-key’ hypothesis. • Investigate and explain the effects of temperature and pH on the rate of enzyme-catalysed reactions. Figure 4.7 Enzyme-based biological detergent How Does an Enzyme Work?Enzymes are highly specific in their action. For example, amylases only act on starch, and not on proteins or fats. Similarly, proteases act only on proteins, and lipases only on fats. This enzyme specificity means that each chemical reaction inside a cell is catalysed by a unique enzyme.']"

Cells\xa0are the building blocks of life. They are the simplest structural and functional units of\xa0life.What do you think cells do? To answer this question, you need to imagine your cells as chemical factories. Many chemical reactions occur continually inside these factories to keep you alive. For example:• A cell takes in raw materials. • Then, it processes these materials to make new molecules.• These molecules can either be used by the cell itself or transported to other parts of the\xa0body. In any factory, there are different departments that carry out different functions. A cell also has different structures that perform different roles within the cell. For example, mitochondria provide energy for cell activities, and chloroplasts carry out photosynthesis. Such division of labour increases efficiency within the system. It ensures that the cell can survive and perform its role within the body. How Did Cells Get Their Name? The term ‘cells’ was first introduced by an English scientist, Robert Hooke, in 1667.He used one of the earliest microscopes to examine thin slices of cork from the barkof a tree (Figure\xa01.1). Hooke saw closely packed little boxes with thick walls. He named the\xa0boxes ‘cells’, just like the cells in a honeycomb or a prison. In fact, Hooke only saw the walls of dead plant cells.  1.1 What Are Cells?

These pictures are called micrographs.• Light micrographscan come out as colour images.• Electron micrographsare black-and-white images, but they can be artificially colourised.To get a clearer picture of how a cell is constructed, we may need to make a section of the cell at different planes (Figure 1.3).

Cells\xa0are the building blocks of life. They are the simplest structural and functional units of\xa0life.What do you think cells do? To answer this question, you need to imagine your cells as chemical factories. Many chemical reactions occur continually inside these factories to keep you alive. For example:• A cell takes in raw materials. • Then, it processes these materials to make new molecules.• These molecules can either be used by the cell itself or transported to other parts of the\xa0body. In any factory, there are different departments that carry out different functions. A cell also has different structures that perform different roles within the cell. For example, mitochondria provide energy for cell activities, and chloroplasts carry out photosynthesis. Such division of labour increases efficiency within the system. It ensures that the cell can survive and perform its role within the body. How Did Cells Get Their Name? The term ‘cells’ was first introduced by an English scientist, Robert Hooke, in 1667.He used one of the earliest microscopes to examine thin slices of cork from the barkof a tree (Figure\xa01.1). Hooke saw closely packed little boxes with thick walls. He named the\xa0boxes ‘cells’, just like the cells in a honeycomb or a prison. In fact, Hooke only saw the walls of dead plant cells.  1.1 What Are Cells? Learning Outcomes• Identify and state the functions of the following cell structures (including organelles) of typical plant and animal cells from diagrams, light micrographs and as seen under the light\xa0microscope using prepared slides and fresh material treated with an appropriate temporary staining technique: cell wall, cell membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, cell vacuoles (large, sap-filled in plant cells, small, temporary in animal cells), chloroplasts.• Identify and state the functions of the following membrane systems and organelles from\xa0diagrams and electron micrographs: endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi body, mitochondria,\xa0ribosomes.• Compare the structure of typical animal and plant cells.

This helps us to build up a three-dimensional picture of the cell.Figure 1.2 Microscopes How Can We Study the Parts of the Cell?Most cells are too small to be seen with our eyes alone. We can use light and electron microscopes to help us to see cells and their parts. Over 300 years ago, biologists like Robert Hooke and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek created their own light microscopes to study microscopic objects!• Light microscopesmagnify objects up to 1000x (spoken: one thousand times) (Figure 1.2(a)). • Electron microscopesmagnify objects to more than 200\xa0000x (spoken: two hundred thousand times)(Figure 1.2(b)).A camera can be fitted to either type of microscope to take pictures. These pictures are called micrographs.• Light micrographscan come out as colour images.• Electron micrographsare black-and-white images, but they can be artificially colourised.To get a clearer picture of how a cell is constructed, we may need to make a section of the cell at different planes (Figure 1.3).

What is the function of the rough endoplasmic reticulum in a cell?," The rough endoplasmic reticulum is responsible for protein synthesis in a cell, as ribosomes are attached to its outer surface.","['6 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 Rough Endoplasmic ReticulumRough endoplasmic reticulum (RER)consists of a network of flattened spaces lined with a membrane (Figure 1.9). (Greek: endoplasm= within the cytoplasm; reticulum= network).• Its surface appears rough when viewed under the electron microscope. This is because small particles called ribosomes are attached to its outer surface (Figure 1.10).• The outer surface of the RER is continuous with the nuclear membrane. Figure 1.9 Three-dimensional diagram of endoplasmic reticulum membrane lined with ribosomes Figure 1.10 Colourised electron micrograph of membrane lined with ribosomes Figure 1.7 Diagram showing parts of the nucleus (three-dimensional reconstruction of images seen under an electron microscope)To see the individual parts of the nucleus clearly, we will need to use an electron microscope (Figure 1.7).  Chromosomes• Each chromosome is a longthread-like structure found within the nucleus. (A\xa0human cell contains46 chromosomes.)• It is made up of proteins and a compound called deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA. Hereditary information is stored in DNA. DNA carries instructions that a cell needs for carrying out its activities. • When the cell is dividing, the chromosomes condense and shorten to become thick, rod-shaped structures.Nuclear membraneseparates the contents of the nucleus from the rest of the cytoplasm. Figure 1.8 shows the appearance of chromosomes during cell division.chromosomesFigure 1.8 Highly magnified (25 000x) and colourised electron micrograph of chromosomes during cell division 7 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 Figure 1.11 Colourised electron micrograph of SER  Figure 1.12 Golgi bodyRibosomesRibosomesare small round structures. They are either attached to the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) or lie freely in the cytoplasm (Figure 1.6 on page 5). They are needed to synthesise proteins in the cell.• The ribosomes attached to the RER make proteins that are usually transported out of the cell.• The ribosomes lying freely in the cytoplasm make proteins that are used within the cytoplasm of that cell. The RER transports proteins made by ribosomes to the Golgi body for secretion out of the cell. Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER)does not have ribosomes attached to its membrane. SER is more tubular than RER (see Figure 1.11). It is connected to the RER. The SER:• synthesises substances such as fats and steroids(sex\xa0hormones in\xa0mammals are steroids)• converts harmful substances into harmless substances through a process known as detoxificationGolgi body The Golgi body(also known as Golgi apparatus) is shaped like a disc. It consists of a stack of flattened spaces surrounded by membranes. Vesicles(tiny spherical spaces enclosed by a membrane) can be seen fusing with one side of the Golgi body and pinching off from the opposite side (Figure 1.12).The Golgi body:• chemically modifies substances made by the ER• stores and packages these substances in vesicles for secretion out of the cell (b)Three-dimensional view of Golgi bodytubule of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (a) Colourised electron micrograph of Golgi body (6 250×)flat spacemembrane What role do fats play in your body?

Mitochondria Mitochondria(singular: mitochondrion) are small oval or sausage-shaped organelles (Figure 1.14). Aerobic respiration occurs in the mitochondria. During aerobic respiration, food substances are broken down to release energy (see Chapter 7). This energy may be used by the cell to perform cell activities such as growth and reproduction.  9 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 Figure 1.16 Chloroplast(a)Three-dimensional diagram of a chloroplastCompare the general structure of the plant cell (Figure 1.15(a)) with that of the animal cell (Figure 1.15(b)).

VacuolesA vacuoleis a fluid-filled space enclosed by a partially permeable membrane. Vacuoles store substances within the cell. Plant cells have a large central vacuole which contains a liquid called cell sap. Cell sapcontains dissolved substances such as sugars, mineral salts and amino\xa0acids.

Cell MembraneThe cell membrane surrounds the cytoplasm of the cell. The cell membrane is made up of lipidsand proteins. It is a partially permeable membrane. This means that it allows only some substances to pass through it. Hence, the cell membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of the\xa0cell. Cell WallA plant cell also has a cell wallthat encloses the entire plant cell, surrounding the cell membrane (Figure 1.5). This cell wall is made of cellulose. It protects the cell from injury and gives the plant cell a fixed shape. The cell wall is fully permeable, so it does not control the type of substances that enter or leave the cell. The cell wall is absent in animal cells. Figure 1.4 A generalised animal cell showing some major organelles SystemsCells are highly organised biological systems with many organelles. While each organelle performs specific functions, the various organelles work as a co-ordinated system within the cell to carry out processes needed to sustain life. Disciplinary Idea Helpful Note The terms ‘cell surface membrane’ and ‘cell membrane’ are used in this book to refer to the membrane enclosing the entire cell. Organelles inside the cell are also enclosed by their own membranes. Word AlertMitochodrion:singular for mitochondriaLipids:biological molecules that are not soluble in water. Examples of lipids are fats, waxes and oils. 5 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 CytoplasmThe cytoplasm is a jelly-like substance that fills the inside of the cell and is enclosed by the cell membrane. It is the part of the protoplasm between the cell membrane and the nucleus. It is where most cell activities occur. The cytoplasm contains organelles. An organelleis a cellular structure that performs a specific job within a cell.Organelles carry out many functions in the cell. You will learn more about them in later parts of this chapter. Many organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi bodyand ribosomesare not visible under the light microscope. They can only be studied under the electron microscope. What Are the Parts of the Cytoplasm?The cytoplasm contains tiny structures called organelles (Figure 1.6). Each organelleis specialised for a particular function. Examples of these organelles are nucleus, rough endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, Golgi body, mitochondria, chloroplasts and vacuoles.  Figure 1.6 Organelles in an animal cell seen under an electron microscope NucleusThe nucleus is surrounded by a membrane called the nuclear membrane. The nucleus contains genetic information in the form of chromosomes. You will learn more about chromosomes later in this section. These are the functions of the nucleus:• It controls cell activities such as cell growth and the repair of worn-out parts.• It is essential for cell division. Cells without a nucleus, like the red blood cells of a mammal, are unable to divide.']"

There are two types of tissues: simple tissue and complex tissue. An example of simple tissue is the muscular tissue. Complex tissues contain more than one type of cells, e.g. blood (Figure\xa01.19) and xylem (Figure 1.20). An organ consists of more than one kind of tissue, all working together to perform a specific function. Examples of organs are the stomach and leaf.An organ system consists of several organs working together for a common purpose. Examples of organ systems in humans include the digestive system, circulatory system, respiratory system and transport system. In plants, examples of organ systems include the root system and the shoot system. Various systems together make up the entire body of an organism.

ABCPlant Tissue Culture ScientistPlant cells have an amazing ability to develop into an entire plant. This ability is called cellular totipotency. Plant tissue culture scientists make use of this ability to develop plants in the laboratories from plant tissue culture (Figure 1.22). This method reduces the time to produce new varieties, as compared to traditional breeding methods.Plant tissue culture has far-reaching applications, especially in agriculture. Specific breeds of plants that are resistant to diseases can now be produced in large numbers. In forestry, this technique is useful for large scale propagationof forest trees.How do you think this technique can help our environment and improve the lives of people in less developed countries?Cool Career Figure 1.22 Scientist cutting plant tissue culture in a Petri dish Word AlertPropagation:growing and planting new trees 15 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 TechConnectWe can now create chicken meat from chicken muscle cells cultured in the laboratory (Figure 1.24). Would this mean that we can produce a functioning organ in the laboratory by using cells that form the particular organ?Scientists may be able to make a three-dimensional model of an organ in the laboratory. However, many natural biological reactions taking place in an organ system cannot be reproduced in a model. Tissue engineers can now study a variety of natural biological reactions in an organ by placing the respective cells on a microchip. A simplified model for study is created in this way.These do not look anywhere near how our natural organs may look, but they are functional and they enable scientists to study the processes that take place in each organ, with almost complete control within the laboratory.Find out more about the benefits of using models to study processes in the human\xa0body. Figure 1.24 Meat cultured in the laboratory from stem cells  For many years, scientists and doctors have been injecting healthy blood stem cells into patients who suffer from leukaemia, a type of cancer of the blood. This method, known as bone marrow transplant, has been a highly effective treatment, increasing the survival rates of patients substantially.In recent years, scientists have developed several other methods of using cells to treat different diseases. These methods use a special type of cell called stem cells. Stem cells, unlike other cells in the body, are not specialised cells and thus have the ability to develop into other specialised cell types (Figure 1.25). This opens up a whole range of possibilities. Cells of different organs can be potentially grown in the laboratory and transplanted into the organs of humans. A patient's immune cells could be modified to recognise cancerous cells in the lymph nodes and destroy them. There are still a lot of challenges that scientists need to overcome. In the near future, we may be able to make use of cells to treat diseases that were once considered untreatable.

There are two types of tissues: simple tissue and complex tissue. An example of simple tissue is the muscular tissue. Complex tissues contain more than one type of cells, e.g. blood (Figure\xa01.19) and xylem (Figure 1.20). An organ consists of more than one kind of tissue, all working together to perform a specific function. Examples of organs are the stomach and leaf.An organ system consists of several organs working together for a common purpose. Examples of organ systems in humans include the digestive system, circulatory system, respiratory system and transport system. In plants, examples of organ systems include the root system and the shoot system. Various systems together make up the entire body of an organism.

Cells\xa0are the building blocks of life. They are the simplest structural and functional units of\xa0life.What do you think cells do? To answer this question, you need to imagine your cells as chemical factories. Many chemical reactions occur continually inside these factories to keep you alive. For example:• A cell takes in raw materials. • Then, it processes these materials to make new molecules.• These molecules can either be used by the cell itself or transported to other parts of the\xa0body. In any factory, there are different departments that carry out different functions. A cell also has different structures that perform different roles within the cell. For example, mitochondria provide energy for cell activities, and chloroplasts carry out photosynthesis. Such division of labour increases efficiency within the system. It ensures that the cell can survive and perform its role within the body. How Did Cells Get Their Name? The term ‘cells’ was first introduced by an English scientist, Robert Hooke, in 1667.He used one of the earliest microscopes to examine thin slices of cork from the barkof a tree (Figure\xa01.1). Hooke saw closely packed little boxes with thick walls. He named the\xa0boxes ‘cells’, just like the cells in a honeycomb or a prison. In fact, Hooke only saw the walls of dead plant cells.  1.1 What Are Cells? Learning Outcomes• Identify and state the functions of the following cell structures (including organelles) of typical plant and animal cells from diagrams, light micrographs and as seen under the light\xa0microscope using prepared slides and fresh material treated with an appropriate temporary staining technique: cell wall, cell membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, cell vacuoles (large, sap-filled in plant cells, small, temporary in animal cells), chloroplasts.• Identify and state the functions of the following membrane systems and organelles from\xa0diagrams and electron micrographs: endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi body, mitochondria,\xa0ribosomes.• Compare the structure of typical animal and plant cells. Figure 1.1 Robert Hooke observed that cork is made up of tiny cells.  3 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 Figure 1.3 We may cut a cell in two different ways in order to view cell structures from different angles. This helps us to build up a three-dimensional picture of the cell.Figure 1.2 Microscopes How Can We Study the Parts of the Cell?Most cells are too small to be seen with our eyes alone. We can use light and electron microscopes to help us to see cells and their parts. Over 300 years ago, biologists like Robert Hooke and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek created their own light microscopes to study microscopic objects!• Light microscopesmagnify objects up to 1000x (spoken: one thousand times) (Figure 1.2(a)). • Electron microscopesmagnify objects to more than 200\xa0000x (spoken: two hundred thousand times)(Figure 1.2(b)).A camera can be fitted to either type of microscope to take pictures. These pictures are called micrographs.• Light micrographscan come out as colour images.• Electron micrographsare black-and-white images, but they can be artificially colourised.To get a clearer picture of how a cell is constructed, we may need to make a section of the cell at different planes (Figure 1.3).

(i.e., cutting acrossthe length of the cell)(a)Cutting a longitudinal section (L.S.)(i.e., cutting alongthe length of the cell)(b)electron microscope(a)light microscope What Does a Cell Consist Of? A cellis a unit of life. It consists of a mass of living matter called protoplasm.While all the cells of your body may not look the same, they all have similar parts. Each living cell consists of living material called protoplasm(Greek: protos= first; plasm= form). Protoplasm is a complex jelly-like substance. Many chemical activities that allow the cell to survive and grow are carried out in the protoplasm.Scan the QR code to watch a clip and have a glimpse of the structures inside the cell.Biology Connect', '4 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 Figure 1.5 A generalised plant cell The protoplasm of a cell is made up of three parts: the cell membrane(also known as cell surface membrane), cytoplasmand nucleus(Figure 1.4). Cell MembraneThe cell membrane surrounds the cytoplasm of the cell. The cell membrane is made up of lipidsand proteins. It is a partially permeable membrane. This means that it allows only some substances to pass through it. Hence, the cell membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of the\xa0cell. Cell WallA plant cell also has a cell wallthat encloses the entire plant cell, surrounding the cell membrane (Figure 1.5). This cell wall is made of cellulose. It protects the cell from injury and gives the plant cell a fixed shape. The cell wall is fully permeable, so it does not control the type of substances that enter or leave the cell. The cell wall is absent in animal cells. Figure 1.4 A generalised animal cell showing some major organelles SystemsCells are highly organised biological systems with many organelles. While each organelle performs specific functions, the various organelles work as a co-ordinated system within the cell to carry out processes needed to sustain life. Disciplinary Idea Helpful Note The terms ‘cell surface membrane’ and ‘cell membrane’ are used in this book to refer to the membrane enclosing the entire cell. Organelles inside the cell are also enclosed by their own membranes. Word AlertMitochodrion:singular for mitochondriaLipids:biological molecules that are not soluble in water. Examples of lipids are fats, waxes and oils. 5 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 CytoplasmThe cytoplasm is a jelly-like substance that fills the inside of the cell and is enclosed by the cell membrane. It is the part of the protoplasm between the cell membrane and the nucleus. It is where most cell activities occur. The cytoplasm contains organelles. An organelleis a cellular structure that performs a specific job within a cell.Organelles carry out many functions in the cell. You will learn more about them in later parts of this chapter. Many organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi bodyand ribosomesare not visible under the light microscope. They can only be studied under the electron microscope. What Are the Parts of the Cytoplasm?The cytoplasm contains tiny structures called organelles (Figure 1.6). Each organelleis specialised for a particular function. Examples of these organelles are nucleus, rough endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, Golgi body, mitochondria, chloroplasts and vacuoles.  Figure 1.6 Organelles in an animal cell seen under an electron microscope NucleusThe nucleus is surrounded by a membrane called the nuclear membrane. The nucleus contains genetic information in the form of chromosomes. You will learn more about chromosomes later in this section. These are the functions of the nucleus:• It controls cell activities such as cell growth and the repair of worn-out parts.• It is essential for cell division. Cells without a nucleus, like the red blood cells of a mammal, are unable to divide.']"
Why do some cells have different shapes and structures compared to others?," Cells have different shapes and structures to serve their different functions, as well as specialized organelles that perform specific roles within the cell.

These cells differ in size and shape and they perform specific functions. For example:• the human body has liver cells, nerve cells and skin cells, and• the bougainvillea plant has guard cells and root hair cells.

This method reduces the time to produce new varieties, as compared to traditional breeding methods.Plant tissue culture has far-reaching applications, especially in agriculture.

Would this mean that we can produce a functioning organ in the laboratory by using cells that form the particular organ?Scientists may be able to make a three-dimensional model of an organ in the laboratory. However, many natural biological reactions taking place in an organ system cannot be reproduced in a model. Tissue engineers can now study a variety of natural biological reactions in an organ by placing the respective cells on a microchip. A simplified model for study is created in this way.These do not look anywhere near how our natural organs may look, but they are functional and they enable scientists to study the processes that take place in each organ, with almost complete control within the laboratory.Find out more about the benefits of using models to study processes in the human\xa0body. Figure 1.24 Meat cultured in the laboratory from stem cells  For many years, scientists and doctors have been injecting healthy blood stem cells into patients who suffer from leukaemia, a type of cancer of the blood. This method, known as bone marrow transplant, has been a highly effective treatment, increasing the survival rates of patients substantially.In recent years, scientists have developed several other methods of using cells to treat different diseases. These methods use a special type of cell called stem cells. Stem cells, unlike other cells in the body, are not specialised cells and thus have the ability to develop into other specialised cell types (Figure 1.25). This opens up a whole range of possibilities. Cells of different organs can be potentially grown in the laboratory and transplanted into the organs of humans. A patient's immune cells could be modified to recognise cancerous cells in the lymph nodes and destroy them. There are still a lot of challenges that scientists need to overcome.

Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances.Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells.TechConnectIn Singapore, there are five NEWater plants that supply Singapore with up to 40% of its water needs. The NEWater process involves recycling treated used water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water. One of the stages of the NEWater production process is reverse osmosis. Similar to osmosis, this process involves a partially permeable membrane. However, pressure is applied to move water molecules across the membrane in a direction that is opposite to that of osmosis.Reverse osmosis can remove toxins from water. By this method, very small particles can be removed by using an electric pump to force water under high pressure through a membrane (Figure 2.19). The membrane is partially permeable and has very tiny pores, which allow only very small molecules such as water molecules to pass through. The water is passed through the membrane several times until pure water is obtained.Why do you think NEWater is an important source of water for Singapore? Figure 2.19 Reverse osmosis water treatment systemFigure 2.18 represents graphically how water potential is associated with osmosis. Figure 2.18 Graphical representation of water potential gradient Osmosisis the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane. Similar to diffusion, the rate of osmosis can be affected by factors such as:• water potential gradient • distance over which water molecules need to move • surface area-to-volume ratio 31 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Higher Water\xa0Potential? When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell).A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall. An animal cell will swell and may even burst in a solution of higher water potential than its cytoplasm (Figure 2.21). This is because, unlike plants, it does not have a cell wall to protect it. What Happens to a Cell in a Solution of the Same Water\xa0Potential?Cells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.Figure 2.20 A plant cell in a solution with higher water potential Figure 2.21 An animal cell in a solution with higher water potentialHomeostasis, Co-ordination and ResponseThrough the processes of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, the internal environments of living organisms are kept constant to provide the optimal conditions for cells to survive.Disciplinary Idea placed in a solution of higher water potentialAs water molecules enter the cell, the vacuole increases in size and pushes the cytoplasm against the cell wall. The cell does not burst because it is protected by the inelastic cell wall. The turgidity of the cell with water is called turgor. The pressure exerted by the water in the vacuole is the turgor pressure. 4 The cell expands or swells. The cell is said to become turgid. 3 When a plant cell is placed in a solution of higher water potential, the cell sap has lower water potential than that of the solution outside the cell. 1plant cell cell sap in vacuole By osmosis, water molecules enter the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane. 2LinkHuman cells must be surrounded by fluid in relatively constant water potential. Read more about how this is done in Chapter 9.', '32 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Lower Water\xa0Potential?When a cell is placed in a solution with a lower water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (inside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (outside the cell).A plant cell will decrease in size and become limp (Figure 2.22). Placing an animal cell in a solution with lower water potential will cause it to lose water. The cell shrinks and spikes appear on the cell (Figure 2.23). This process is called crenation. An animal cell will become dehydrated and eventually die when placed in a solution with a low water potential. Figure 2.22 A plant cell in a solution with lower water potential Figure 2.23 An animal cell in a solution with lower water potential By osmosis, water molecules from the vacuole and cytoplasm leave the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane. 2 placed in a solution of lower water potential As the cell loses water, the vacuole decreases in size. The cytoplasm shrinks away from the cell wall. The shrinkage of cytoplasm and cell membrane away from the cell wall is called plasmolysis. The cell is said to be plasmolysed. A plasmolysed cell can be restored to its original state by placing it in water or in a solution with higher water potential. 4 The cell decreases in size and becomes flaccid or limp. 3 When a plant cell is immersed in a solution with lower water potential, the cell sap has a higher water potential than the solution outside the cell. 1plant cell cell sap in vacuole 33 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Figure 2.25 Cells of onion leaf epidermis (stained)Figure 2.24 Electron micrograph of stomata Figure 2.26 Effects of turgor pressure on plants Why Is Turgor Important in Plants?Turgor, or how turgid cells are, plays an important role in maintaining the shape of soft tissues in plants. The young stems and leaves of herbaceous and non-woody plants are able to remain firm and erect. This is because of the turgor pressure within their cells. When there is a high rate of water loss from the cells, they lose their turgidity and the plant wilts. The movements of certain plant parts are due to changes in turgor. For example, changes in the turgor of the guard cells cause the opening and closing of the stomata (Figure 2.24). Plasmolysis causes cells to become flaccid or limp (Figure 2.25). Cells will be killed if they remain plasmolysed for too long. Thus, it is not advisable to add too much fertiliser around the roots of plants because the soil solution will become very concentrated and water molecules will move out of the roots by\xa0osmosis. Inability of the roots to absorb water, together with continued evaporation of water from the leaves, will cause the plant to wilt. Unless sufficient water is added to dilute the soil solution, the plant will eventually die (Figure 2.26).Helpful Note Soil solution is a thin film of water that surrounds individual soil particles. It usually contains dissolved mineral salts or ions.

Plant tissue culture scientists make use of this ability to develop plants in the laboratories from plant tissue culture (Figure 1.22). This method reduces the time to produce new varieties, as compared to traditional breeding methods.Plant tissue culture has far-reaching applications, especially in agriculture. Specific breeds of plants that are resistant to diseases can now be produced in large numbers.

Would this mean that we can produce a functioning organ in the laboratory by using cells that form the particular organ?Scientists may be able to make a three-dimensional model of an organ in the laboratory. However, many natural biological reactions taking place in an organ system cannot be reproduced in a model. Tissue engineers can now study a variety of natural biological reactions in an organ by placing the respective cells on a microchip. A simplified model for study is created in this way.These do not look anywhere near how our natural organs may look, but they are functional and they enable scientists to study the processes that take place in each organ, with almost complete control within the laboratory.Find out more about the benefits of using models to study processes in the human\xa0body. Figure 1.24 Meat cultured in the laboratory from stem cells  For many years, scientists and doctors have been injecting healthy blood stem cells into patients who suffer from leukaemia, a type of cancer of the blood. This method, known as bone marrow transplant, has been a highly effective treatment, increasing the survival rates of patients substantially.In recent years, scientists have developed several other methods of using cells to treat different diseases. These methods use a special type of cell called stem cells. Stem cells, unlike other cells in the body, are not specialised cells and thus have the ability to develop into other specialised cell types (Figure 1.25). This opens up a whole range of possibilities. Cells of different organs can be potentially grown in the laboratory and transplanted into the organs of humans. A patient's immune cells could be modified to recognise cancerous cells in the lymph nodes and destroy them. There are still a lot of challenges that scientists need to overcome. In the near future, we may be able to make use of cells to treat diseases that were once considered untreatable.

A permeable membrane allows both the solvent (water) and the solutes (the dissolved substances) to pass through it.Eventually, there will be equal concentrations of all particles on both sides of the membrane. Figure 2.5 Diffusion of potassium nitrate and copper(II) sulfate particles through a permeable membrane  Observation and Discussion1Using the concept of concentration gradient, explain why the blue colour of copper(II) sulfate gradually spreads throughout the water in the jar. 2When does diffusion stop?As you saw in Let’s Investigate 2.1, the particles of copper(II) sulfate moved from a region of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration in the surrounding water. In other words, the solute particles diffused evenly throughout the liquid to form a solution.If there is more than one substance dissolved in the same liquid, then the dissolved particles of one substance will diffuse independently of the others.As a result:• The dissolved particles of copper(II) sulfate will diffuse across the membrane to the left side of the beaker.• The dissolved particles of potassium nitrate will diffuse across the membrane to the right side of the beaker.  23 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Solutes can also diffuse, for example, in the small intestine when dissolved amino acids and glucose are absorbed by diffusion into the blood capillaries.

Factors That Affect the Rate of Diffusion The rate of diffusion can be affected by factors such as:• concentration gradient• diffusion distance• surface area-to-volume ratioHow concentration gradient affects the rate of diffusion has been discussed on page 21.Diffusion DistanceThe time taken for a substance to move from one point to another depends on the distance between the two points. The distance through which a substance diffuses is called the diffusion distance. The shorter the diffusion distance, the less time is needed for the substance to travel, and hence the rate of diffusion is higher. In living organisms, the cell membrane is not like the membrane in Figure\xa02.6. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. For example, oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass through the cell membrane but proteins cannot. Diffusion is an important way by which oxygen and carbon dioxide move into and out of cells. Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs takes place by diffusion (Figure 2.6(a)). Plant cells such as root hair cells also take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide by diffusion (Figure 2.6(b)).

Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances.Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells.TechConnectIn Singapore, there are five NEWater plants that supply Singapore with up to 40% of its water needs. The NEWater process involves recycling treated used water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water. One of the stages of the NEWater production process is reverse osmosis. Similar to osmosis, this process involves a partially permeable membrane. However, pressure is applied to move water molecules across the membrane in a direction that is opposite to that of osmosis.Reverse osmosis can remove toxins from water. By this method, very small particles can be removed by using an electric pump to force water under high pressure through a membrane (Figure 2.19). The membrane is partially permeable and has very tiny pores, which allow only very small molecules such as water molecules to pass through. The water is passed through the membrane several times until pure water is obtained.Why do you think NEWater is an important source of water for Singapore? Figure 2.19 Reverse osmosis water treatment systemFigure 2.18 represents graphically how water potential is associated with osmosis. Figure 2.18 Graphical representation of water potential gradient Osmosisis the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane. Similar to diffusion, the rate of osmosis can be affected by factors such as:• water potential gradient • distance over which water molecules need to move • surface area-to-volume ratio 31 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Higher Water\xa0Potential? When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell).A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall. An animal cell will swell and may even burst in a solution of higher water potential than its cytoplasm (Figure 2.21). This is because, unlike plants, it does not have a cell wall to protect it. What Happens to a Cell in a Solution of the Same Water\xa0Potential?Cells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.Figure 2.20 A plant cell in a solution with higher water potential Figure 2.21 An animal cell in a solution with higher water potentialHomeostasis, Co-ordination and ResponseThrough the processes of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, the internal environments of living organisms are kept constant to provide the optimal conditions for cells to survive.Disciplinary Idea placed in a solution of higher water potentialAs water molecules enter the cell, the vacuole increases in size and pushes the cytoplasm against the cell wall.

Cell MembraneThe cell membrane surrounds the cytoplasm of the cell. The cell membrane is made up of lipidsand proteins. It is a partially permeable membrane. This means that it allows only some substances to pass through it. Hence, the cell membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of the\xa0cell. Cell WallA plant cell also has a cell wallthat encloses the entire plant cell, surrounding the cell membrane (Figure 1.5). This cell wall is made of cellulose. It protects the cell from injury and gives the plant cell a fixed shape. The cell wall is fully permeable, so it does not control the type of substances that enter or leave the cell. The cell wall is absent in animal cells. Figure 1.4 A generalised animal cell showing some major organelles SystemsCells are highly organised biological systems with many organelles. While each organelle performs specific functions, the various organelles work as a co-ordinated system within the cell to carry out processes needed to sustain life.

The nucleus contains genetic information in the form of chromosomes. You will learn more about chromosomes later in this section. These are the functions of the nucleus:• It controls cell activities such as cell growth and the repair of worn-out parts.• It is essential for cell division.

What is diffusion and how does it play a role in the spread of scents like perfume in a room?," Diffusion is the movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration, while osmosis is the movement of water molecules from a solution of higher water potential to a solution of lower water potential. Diffusion requires no partially permeable membrane, while osmosis requires a partially permeable membrane.","['20 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 2.1 What Is Diffusion? Learning Outcomes• Define diffusion and describe its role in nutrient uptake and gaseous exchange in plants and\xa0humans. • Describe the factors that affect the rate of diffusion. DiffusionImagine that you are sitting in the living room reading a book. Your sister accidentally spills a bottle of perfume in the living room. Gradually, you become aware of a pleasant scent spreading through the living room.Figure 2.1 illustrates how diffusion takes place. Figure 2.1 Diffusion of perfume particlesPerfume, like all matter, is made up of particles such as atoms, molecules or ions.Individual particles of perfume evaporate from the surface of the spill, that is, they become a\xa0gas.The gas particles have kinetic energy and are constantly moving in all directions. They bump into one another and move about randomly.This causes the gas to spread throughout the house, until it reaches your nose and you smell it. The gas spreads outwards through a process called diffusion.What Is a Concentration Gradient and How Is It Related to\xa0Diffusion?In Figure 2.1, point A represents the location where the bottle of perfume was spilled. Point B represents you in the living room, some distance away. Concentration refers to the amount of a substance within a fixed volume. The concentration of gas particles is higher at A than at B. Thus, there is a difference in concentration between points A and B. This concentration difference can be shown on a graph (Figure 2.2) and is referred to as the concentration gradient. 2 4 3 1 PhysicsWe learn that the random movement of microscopic particles is known as Brownian motion.Link 1 2 3 4 AB 21 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 In Figure 2.2, the height of the blue line shows the concentration at each point. If we join the concentrations at A and B, we get a straight line, which is sloped or has a gradient. This red dotted line is the concentration gradientbetween A and B.Concentration gradient is the difference in concentration between two\xa0regions.The particles of fluids (liquids and gases) possess movement (kinetic) energy. They are continuously moving about. As their movement is random, the particles will move (diffuse) down the concentration gradient and become evenly spaced out after some time (Figure 2.3). In Figure 2.1, the smell of perfume diffuses throughout the house.• Diffusion can thus be described as the net movement of particles down a concentration gradient.• Thesteeper the concentration gradient for a substance, the faster the rate of diffusion for that substance.Diffusion is the net movement of particles (atoms, molecules or ions) from\xa0a region where they are of higher concentration to a region where they are of lower concentration, that is, down a concentration gradient.ChemistryWe learn that all matter is made up of tiny particles that are in constant random motion. These moving particles have kinetic energy. Link Figure 2.2 Graphical representation of diffusion Figure 2.3 Arrows showing direction of movement of particles as they space out  Helpful Note Net movement refers to the overall movement of particles. Net movement of particles occurs when the movement of particles in one direction is greater than the movement of particles in the opposite direction.When the two regions have the same number of particles per unit volume, the movement of the particles between the two regions will be the same in both directions. Thus, there will be no net\xa0movement.

Link Compared to arm B, arm A contains: • More sucrose molecules per unit volume• Fewer water molecules per unit volumeAfter some time, the level of solution in arm A rises, while that in arm B falls.What do you think has happened?• Sucrose molecules cannot diffuse from arm A to B because the molecules are too big to pass through the pores of the membrane. • Water molecules move from B to A because solution B has more water molecules per unit volume than solution A. A dilute solution has more water molecules per unit volume than a concentrated solution of the same volume.Net result: Both arms A and B have the same solute concentration (same number of solute molecules per unit volume).The diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane is called osmosis. 2.2 What Is Osmosis?Learning Outcomes• Define osmosis, investigate and describe the effects of osmosis on plant and animal tissues.• Discuss the factors that affect the rate of osmosis. Figure 2.15 Experimental set-up to demonstrate osmosis OsmosisThe cell membrane is a partially permeable membrane. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. Figure 2.15 shows the two arms of a U-tube separated by a partially permeable membrane. This membrane is permeable to water molecules but not to sucrose molecules. Sucrose is cane sugar, also known as table sugar. 29 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Figure 2.17 Water potential gradient set up in the container AimTo demonstrate osmosisProcedure1Tie a knot at one end of a piece of dialysis tubing.2Half-fill a boiling tube with distilled water.3Use a pipette to half-fill the dialysis tubing with sucrose solution. Carefully rinse the outside of the dialysis tubing with distilled water if any sucrose solution is spilled.4Set up the apparatus as shown in Figure\xa02.16. Make sure the levels of the liquid inside and outside the tubing are the same. Use a paper clip to hold the dialysis tubing in place. Mark the level on the outside of the boiling tube.5Set up a second experiment in a similar way but with distilled water in both the dialysis tubing and the boiling tube. 6After 20 minutes, observe and note the level of liquid inside and outside the tubing in each experiment. Observation and Discussion1What can you say about the dialysis tubing? How do you account for your observation in step 6?2What is the purpose of the second experimental set-up? Let’s Investigate 2.4 What Is Water Potential and How Is It Related to Osmosis?• The term ‘water potential’ is always used in connection with osmosis. Water potential is a measure of the tendency of water molecules to move from one place to another. A dilute solution (solution with lower concentration of solute) would have a higher water potential than a concentrated solution. Hence, water molecules would move out of the dilute solution and into the concentrated solution through osmosis.• When a partially permeable membrane separates two solutions of different water potentials, a water potential gradient is established (Figure 2.17). Water molecules move from a region with higher water potential to a region with a lower one, that is, down a water potential gradient.

A scape (leafless flower stalk), e.g. Chinese leek, can also be used to demonstrate osmosis in living tissue. Figure 2.28(a) shows a section of a scape. A scape has two main layers of cells; the outer epidermal cells and the cortical cells. Only the outer epidermal cells are covered by a waterproof cuticle that protects the plant tissue against water loss.One cut strip is placed in water and another in concentrated sucrose solution (Figure 2.28(b)).

Why is it important for living organisms to have a high rate of diffusion?," A high rate of diffusion is important for living organisms because it allows for the exchange of gases and other essential substances with the environment, which is necessary for survival. It also helps maintain a consistent internal environment for optimal cell function through processes like osmosis and active transport.","['22 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Diffusion Across a MembraneFigure 2.5 illustrates the process of diffusion through a permeable\xa0membrane. A permeable membrane allows both the solvent (water) and the solutes (the dissolved substances) to pass through it.Eventually, there will be equal concentrations of all particles on both sides of the membrane. Figure 2.5 Diffusion of potassium nitrate and copper(II) sulfate particles through a permeable membrane  Observation and Discussion1Using the concept of concentration gradient, explain why the blue colour of copper(II) sulfate gradually spreads throughout the water in the jar. 2When does diffusion stop?As you saw in Let’s Investigate 2.1, the particles of copper(II) sulfate moved from a region of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration in the surrounding water. In other words, the solute particles diffused evenly throughout the liquid to form a solution.If there is more than one substance dissolved in the same liquid, then the dissolved particles of one substance will diffuse independently of the others.As a result:• The dissolved particles of copper(II) sulfate will diffuse across the membrane to the left side of the beaker.• The dissolved particles of potassium nitrate will diffuse across the membrane to the right side of the beaker.  23 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Solutes can also diffuse, for example, in the small intestine when dissolved amino acids and glucose are absorbed by diffusion into the blood capillaries. A solute is a substance that has been dissolved in another substance.Figure 2.6 Gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide via diffusion SystemsLiving organisms rely on diffusion to facilitate the exchange of gases with the\xa0environment needed for survival.Disciplinary Idea Link How do humans carry out gas exchange? Read about it in Chapter\xa07.How do plants carry out gas exchange? Read about it in Chapter 12. Factors That Affect the Rate of Diffusion The rate of diffusion can be affected by factors such as:• concentration gradient• diffusion distance• surface area-to-volume ratioHow concentration gradient affects the rate of diffusion has been discussed on page 21.Diffusion DistanceThe time taken for a substance to move from one point to another depends on the distance between the two points. The distance through which a substance diffuses is called the diffusion distance. The shorter the diffusion distance, the less time is needed for the substance to travel, and hence the rate of diffusion is higher. In living organisms, the cell membrane is not like the membrane in Figure\xa02.6. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. For example, oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass through the cell membrane but proteins cannot. Diffusion is an important way by which oxygen and carbon dioxide move into and out of cells. Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs takes place by diffusion (Figure 2.6(a)). Plant cells such as root hair cells also take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide by diffusion (Figure 2.6(b)). In both these scenarios, the diffusion distance is short, allowing diffusion to occur at a higher rate.', '20 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 2.1 What Is Diffusion? Learning Outcomes• Define diffusion and describe its role in nutrient uptake and gaseous exchange in plants and\xa0humans. • Describe the factors that affect the rate of diffusion. DiffusionImagine that you are sitting in the living room reading a book. Your sister accidentally spills a bottle of perfume in the living room. Gradually, you become aware of a pleasant scent spreading through the living room.Figure 2.1 illustrates how diffusion takes place. Figure 2.1 Diffusion of perfume particlesPerfume, like all matter, is made up of particles such as atoms, molecules or ions.Individual particles of perfume evaporate from the surface of the spill, that is, they become a\xa0gas.The gas particles have kinetic energy and are constantly moving in all directions. They bump into one another and move about randomly.This causes the gas to spread throughout the house, until it reaches your nose and you smell it. The gas spreads outwards through a process called diffusion.What Is a Concentration Gradient and How Is It Related to\xa0Diffusion?In Figure 2.1, point A represents the location where the bottle of perfume was spilled. Point B represents you in the living room, some distance away. Concentration refers to the amount of a substance within a fixed volume. The concentration of gas particles is higher at A than at B. Thus, there is a difference in concentration between points A and B. This concentration difference can be shown on a graph (Figure 2.2) and is referred to as the concentration gradient. 2 4 3 1 PhysicsWe learn that the random movement of microscopic particles is known as Brownian motion.Link 1 2 3 4 AB 21 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 In Figure 2.2, the height of the blue line shows the concentration at each point. If we join the concentrations at A and B, we get a straight line, which is sloped or has a gradient. This red dotted line is the concentration gradientbetween A and B.Concentration gradient is the difference in concentration between two\xa0regions.The particles of fluids (liquids and gases) possess movement (kinetic) energy. They are continuously moving about. As their movement is random, the particles will move (diffuse) down the concentration gradient and become evenly spaced out after some time (Figure 2.3). In Figure 2.1, the smell of perfume diffuses throughout the house.• Diffusion can thus be described as the net movement of particles down a concentration gradient.• Thesteeper the concentration gradient for a substance, the faster the rate of diffusion for that substance.Diffusion is the net movement of particles (atoms, molecules or ions) from\xa0a region where they are of higher concentration to a region where they are of lower concentration, that is, down a concentration gradient.ChemistryWe learn that all matter is made up of tiny particles that are in constant random motion. These moving particles have kinetic energy. Link Figure 2.2 Graphical representation of diffusion Figure 2.3 Arrows showing direction of movement of particles as they space out  Helpful Note Net movement refers to the overall movement of particles. Net movement of particles occurs when the movement of particles in one direction is greater than the movement of particles in the opposite direction.When the two regions have the same number of particles per unit volume, the movement of the particles between the two regions will be the same in both directions. Thus, there will be no net\xa0movement. AimTo investigate the diffusion of a dissolved substance in waterProcedure1Drop a copper(II) sulfate crystal into a gas jar full of water as shown in Figure 2.4. Cover the jar and allow it to stand for a few days.2Observe the changes in the colour of the water.  Let’s Investigate 2.1 Figure 2.4 Experimental set-up to demonstrate diffusion', '30 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 How Does Osmosis Affect Living Organisms?A cell is surrounded by a living, partially permeable cell membrane. Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances.Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells.TechConnectIn Singapore, there are five NEWater plants that supply Singapore with up to 40% of its water needs. The NEWater process involves recycling treated used water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water. One of the stages of the NEWater production process is reverse osmosis. Similar to osmosis, this process involves a partially permeable membrane. However, pressure is applied to move water molecules across the membrane in a direction that is opposite to that of osmosis.Reverse osmosis can remove toxins from water. By this method, very small particles can be removed by using an electric pump to force water under high pressure through a membrane (Figure 2.19). The membrane is partially permeable and has very tiny pores, which allow only very small molecules such as water molecules to pass through. The water is passed through the membrane several times until pure water is obtained.Why do you think NEWater is an important source of water for Singapore? Figure 2.19 Reverse osmosis water treatment systemFigure 2.18 represents graphically how water potential is associated with osmosis. Figure 2.18 Graphical representation of water potential gradient Osmosisis the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane. Similar to diffusion, the rate of osmosis can be affected by factors such as:• water potential gradient • distance over which water molecules need to move • surface area-to-volume ratio 31 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Higher Water\xa0Potential? When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell).A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall. An animal cell will swell and may even burst in a solution of higher water potential than its cytoplasm (Figure 2.21). This is because, unlike plants, it does not have a cell wall to protect it. What Happens to a Cell in a Solution of the Same Water\xa0Potential?Cells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.Figure 2.20 A plant cell in a solution with higher water potential Figure 2.21 An animal cell in a solution with higher water potentialHomeostasis, Co-ordination and ResponseThrough the processes of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, the internal environments of living organisms are kept constant to provide the optimal conditions for cells to survive.Disciplinary Idea placed in a solution of higher water potentialAs water molecules enter the cell, the vacuole increases in size and pushes the cytoplasm against the cell wall. The cell does not burst because it is protected by the inelastic cell wall. The turgidity of the cell with water is called turgor. The pressure exerted by the water in the vacuole is the turgor pressure. 4 The cell expands or swells. The cell is said to become turgid. 3 When a plant cell is placed in a solution of higher water potential, the cell sap has lower water potential than that of the solution outside the cell. 1plant cell cell sap in vacuole By osmosis, water molecules enter the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane. 2LinkHuman cells must be surrounded by fluid in relatively constant water potential. Read more about how this is done in Chapter 9.', '36 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Figure 2.30 Difference between active transport and diffusion Active transportis the process in which energy is used to move the particles of a substance across a membrane against its concentration gradient, that is, from a region where the particles are of lower concentration to a region where they are of higher concentration.EnergyEnergy is required during active transport to ensure that substances can be transported against a concentration gradient, which is critical for many biological processes.Disciplinary Idea 2.3 What Is Active Transport?Learning Outcome• Define active transportand discuss its importance as an energy-consuming process by which substances are transported against a concentration gradient, as in ion uptake by root hairs and uptake of glucose by cells in the villi. Living cells are able to absorb certain substances even though these substances are of higher concentration inside the cell than they are in the external environment. This means that the cells are absorbing substances against a concentration gradient (Figure 2.30). Such a process requires energy and is called active transport. 1Humans store food to see them through times when food is in short supply. Unfortunately, bacteria and fungi attack stored food and make it go bad. One way of preventing this is to store food in strong salt solutions (brine) or sugar solutions (syrups) (Figure 2.29). Suggest with reasons why brine or syrups are used in food preservation.2An animal cell is placed in a concentrated solution of sugar.

It is during respiration that energy is released, and part of this energy is used in active transport.In the human body, examples of active transport include the uptake of glucose by the microvilli of epithelial cells in the small intestine, and from the kidney tubules into the blood capillaries.In plants, root hair cells can take in mineral salts from the soil solution by diffusion or active transport, depending on the concentration of mineral salts in the soil solution (Figure 2.31).

Why are cells typically small in size?," Cells are typically small in size because their size allows for more efficient transportation of materials across the cell membrane, and specialized cells have structures that enable them to carry out specific functions. This is known as differentiation.","['26 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Some cells are specifically adapted to absorb substances, for example, root hair cells and the epithelial cells, which line the small intestine (Figure 2.9). Such cells often have long narrow protrusionsor folds in their membranes. These greatly increase the surface area-to-volume ratio of the cell membrane through which materials can be absorbed into the cell.You will learn more about this in Chapter 5.

Cells\xa0are the building blocks of life. They are the simplest structural and functional units of\xa0life.What do you think cells do? To answer this question, you need to imagine your cells as chemical factories. Many chemical reactions occur continually inside these factories to keep you alive. For example:• A cell takes in raw materials. • Then, it processes these materials to make new molecules.• These molecules can either be used by the cell itself or transported to other parts of the\xa0body. In any factory, there are different departments that carry out different functions. A cell also has different structures that perform different roles within the cell. For example, mitochondria provide energy for cell activities, and chloroplasts carry out photosynthesis. Such division of labour increases efficiency within the system. It ensures that the cell can survive and perform its role within the body. How Did Cells Get Their Name? The term ‘cells’ was first introduced by an English scientist, Robert Hooke, in 1667.He used one of the earliest microscopes to examine thin slices of cork from the barkof a tree (Figure\xa01.1). Hooke saw closely packed little boxes with thick walls. He named the\xa0boxes ‘cells’, just like the cells in a honeycomb or a prison. In fact, Hooke only saw the walls of dead plant cells.  1.1 What Are Cells? Learning Outcomes• Identify and state the functions of the following cell structures (including organelles) of typical plant and animal cells from diagrams, light micrographs and as seen under the light\xa0microscope using prepared slides and fresh material treated with an appropriate temporary staining technique: cell wall, cell membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, cell vacuoles (large, sap-filled in plant cells, small, temporary in animal cells), chloroplasts.• Identify and state the functions of the following membrane systems and organelles from\xa0diagrams and electron micrographs: endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi body, mitochondria,\xa0ribosomes.• Compare the structure of typical animal and plant cells. Figure 1.1 Robert Hooke observed that cork is made up of tiny cells.  3 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 Figure 1.3 We may cut a cell in two different ways in order to view cell structures from different angles. This helps us to build up a three-dimensional picture of the cell.Figure 1.2 Microscopes How Can We Study the Parts of the Cell?Most cells are too small to be seen with our eyes alone. We can use light and electron microscopes to help us to see cells and their parts. Over 300 years ago, biologists like Robert Hooke and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek created their own light microscopes to study microscopic objects!• Light microscopesmagnify objects up to 1000x (spoken: one thousand times) (Figure 1.2(a)). • Electron microscopesmagnify objects to more than 200\xa0000x (spoken: two hundred thousand times)(Figure 1.2(b)).A camera can be fitted to either type of microscope to take pictures. These pictures are called micrographs.• Light micrographscan come out as colour images.• Electron micrographsare black-and-white images, but they can be artificially colourised.To get a clearer picture of how a cell is constructed, we may need to make a section of the cell at different planes (Figure 1.3).

A cellis a unit of life. It consists of a mass of living matter called protoplasm.While all the cells of your body may not look the same, they all have similar parts. Each living cell consists of living material called protoplasm(Greek: protos= first; plasm= form). Protoplasm is a complex jelly-like substance. Many chemical activities that allow the cell to survive and grow are carried out in the protoplasm.Scan the QR code to watch a clip and have a glimpse of the structures inside the cell.Biology Connect', '24Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Let’s Investigate 2.2Calculating Surface Area-to-volume Ratios1Consider three cubes of sides 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm respectively. We use three cubes to represent cells of different sizes.2Complete Table 2.1. Table 2.1 Surface area-to-volume ratio of three cubes representing cells of different sizesCubesides 1 cm sides 2 cmsides 3 cmSurface areaArea of one face= 1 cm × 1 cm = 1 cm2Surface area= number of faces ×area of one face= 6 × 1 cm2= 6 cm2VolumeVolume= 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm= 1 cm3Surface area-to-volume ratio6 cm2: 1 cm3 Helpful Note A cube has six square faces. To find the surface area of a cube, find the area of one face and multiply by six. From our calculations, we can observe that as the cube becomes bigger, the surface area does not increase in the same proportion as the volume. The cube of sides 1 cm has 6 cm2of surface area to 1 cm3volume. But the cube of sides 3 cm has only 2 cm2of surface area to 1 cm3volume. The largest cube has the smallest surface area-to-volume ratio. The rate of movement of substances across the largest cube is the slowest. Thus, as a cell grows, the rate of movement of substances across a cell will decrease. Surface Area-to-volume RatioWhat does surface area-to-volume ratio mean to a cell?Why are cells typically small? Why do all large organisms always have bodies made up of many small cells and not just one large cell?The answers to these questions are related to the rate at which materials move across the cell membrane. Cells need to move oxygen, nutrients and waste materials across their cell membrane fast enough to stay alive. The rate of movement of a substance across a cell membrane depends on how large the cell membrane is (i.e. the surface area of the cell). For two cells of the same volume, the one with the larger surface area allows for a higher rate of diffusion. The ratio between the surface area and volume of a cell is called surface area-to-volume ratio, and is an essential concept in biology. The greater the surface area-to-volume ratio of a cell, the higher the rate at which substances move in and out of it. The following investigation will help you better understand surface area-to-volume ratios. 25Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Let’s explore the efficiency of diffusion in three types of cells using the models in Figure 2.7.In Figure 2.7, the larger cell B has more surface area than cell A, but it has less surface area for every unit volume of protoplasm compared to A. The rate of intake of food and oxygen per unit volume is therefore slower in cell\xa0B than in cell A. The cells in root tips and shoot tips are small and actively growing. As a cell continues to grow in size, its growth slows down and stops once it reaches its optimumsize. This is because as the cell grows larger, the rate of oxygen and food intake slows down. Thus, it will not be beneficial for a cell to grow too big. Cell C with sides of 3 cmPortion Z has as an even smaller surface area per unit volume. Therefore, it gets less food and oxygen per unit time compared to Y. The whole cell C is even less active than the other two cells.Cell A with sides of 1 cmThis cell can obtain food and oxygen from all its sides.Cell B with sides of 2 cmPortion Y has the same volume of protoplasm as X. However, its surface area has been reduced by half. It can only obtain half the amount of food and oxygen per unit time compared to X. Thus, the whole cell B can only be half as active as cell A.Figure 2.7 Models to explain what surface area-to-volume ratio means to a cell of increasing size Each shaded square represents the surface area of a unit volume of protoplasm.food and oxygen in waste products out imaginary lines Word AlertOptimum:best or most favourable How do cells adapt their surface area-to-volume ratios?Consider the two shapes in Figure 2.8.

These cells differ in size and shape and they perform specific functions.

How are root hair cells and epithelial cells in the small intestine adapted for absorbing substances?," Root hair cells and epithelial cells in the small intestine are adapted for absorbing substances through specialized structures such as microvilli and villi, which increase the surface area of the cell membrane. This allows for more efficient absorption of nutrients and substances. In addition, these cells have tight junctions that prevent substances from leaking between cells and instead force them to be absorbed through the cells themselves. These adaptations allow the cells to perform their function of absorbing water, mineral salts, and other nutrients effectively.","['26 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Some cells are specifically adapted to absorb substances, for example, root hair cells and the epithelial cells, which line the small intestine (Figure 2.9). Such cells often have long narrow protrusionsor folds in their membranes. These greatly increase the surface area-to-volume ratio of the cell membrane through which materials can be absorbed into the cell.You will learn more about this in Chapter 5.

Living cells are able to absorb certain substances even though these substances are of higher concentration inside the cell than they are in the external environment. This means that the cells are absorbing substances against a concentration gradient (Figure 2.30). Such a process requires energy and is called active transport. 1Humans store food to see them through times when food is in short supply. Unfortunately, bacteria and fungi attack stored food and make it go bad. One way of preventing this is to store food in strong salt solutions (brine) or sugar solutions (syrups) (Figure 2.29).

It is during respiration that energy is released, and part of this energy is used in active transport.In the human body, examples of active transport include the uptake of glucose by the microvilli of epithelial cells in the small intestine, and from the kidney tubules into the blood capillaries.In plants, root hair cells can take in mineral salts from the soil solution by diffusion or active transport, depending on the concentration of mineral salts in the soil solution (Figure 2.31).

What is osmosis and how does it affect plant and animal tissues?," Osmosis is the movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential through a partially permeable membrane. It affects plant and animal tissues differently, with plant cells expanding or swelling due to their cell wall and animal cells potentially bursting without a cell wall. Osmosis can be demonstrated using potato strips or a scape, and the rate of osmosis can be affected by factors such as concentration of solute and temperature. Water potential is a measure of the tendency of water molecules to move and is always used in connection with osmosis.","['30 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 How Does Osmosis Affect Living Organisms?A cell is surrounded by a living, partially permeable cell membrane. Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances.Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells.TechConnectIn Singapore, there are five NEWater plants that supply Singapore with up to 40% of its water needs. The NEWater process involves recycling treated used water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water. One of the stages of the NEWater production process is reverse osmosis. Similar to osmosis, this process involves a partially permeable membrane. However, pressure is applied to move water molecules across the membrane in a direction that is opposite to that of osmosis.Reverse osmosis can remove toxins from water. By this method, very small particles can be removed by using an electric pump to force water under high pressure through a membrane (Figure 2.19). The membrane is partially permeable and has very tiny pores, which allow only very small molecules such as water molecules to pass through. The water is passed through the membrane several times until pure water is obtained.Why do you think NEWater is an important source of water for Singapore? Figure 2.19 Reverse osmosis water treatment systemFigure 2.18 represents graphically how water potential is associated with osmosis. Figure 2.18 Graphical representation of water potential gradient Osmosisis the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane. Similar to diffusion, the rate of osmosis can be affected by factors such as:• water potential gradient • distance over which water molecules need to move • surface area-to-volume ratio 31 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Higher Water\xa0Potential? When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell).A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall. An animal cell will swell and may even burst in a solution of higher water potential than its cytoplasm (Figure 2.21). This is because, unlike plants, it does not have a cell wall to protect it. What Happens to a Cell in a Solution of the Same Water\xa0Potential?Cells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.Figure 2.20 A plant cell in a solution with higher water potential Figure 2.21 An animal cell in a solution with higher water potentialHomeostasis, Co-ordination and ResponseThrough the processes of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, the internal environments of living organisms are kept constant to provide the optimal conditions for cells to survive.Disciplinary Idea placed in a solution of higher water potentialAs water molecules enter the cell, the vacuole increases in size and pushes the cytoplasm against the cell wall. The cell does not burst because it is protected by the inelastic cell wall. The turgidity of the cell with water is called turgor. The pressure exerted by the water in the vacuole is the turgor pressure. 4 The cell expands or swells. The cell is said to become turgid. 3 When a plant cell is placed in a solution of higher water potential, the cell sap has lower water potential than that of the solution outside the cell. 1plant cell cell sap in vacuole By osmosis, water molecules enter the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane. 2LinkHuman cells must be surrounded by fluid in relatively constant water potential.

A scape (leafless flower stalk), e.g. Chinese leek, can also be used to demonstrate osmosis in living tissue. Figure 2.28(a) shows a section of a scape. A scape has two main layers of cells; the outer epidermal cells and the cortical cells. Only the outer epidermal cells are covered by a waterproof cuticle that protects the plant tissue against water loss.One cut strip is placed in water and another in concentrated sucrose solution (Figure 2.28(b)).

Placing an animal cell in a solution with lower water potential will cause it to lose water. The cell shrinks and spikes appear on the cell (Figure 2.23). This process is called crenation. An animal cell will become dehydrated and eventually die when placed in a solution with a low water potential. Figure 2.22 A plant cell in a solution with lower water potential Figure 2.23 An animal cell in a solution with lower water potential By osmosis, water molecules from the vacuole and cytoplasm leave the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane. 2 placed in a solution of lower water potential As the cell loses water, the vacuole decreases in size. The cytoplasm shrinks away from the cell wall. The shrinkage of cytoplasm and cell membrane away from the cell wall is called plasmolysis. The cell is said to be plasmolysed. A plasmolysed cell can be restored to its original state by placing it in water or in a solution with higher water potential. 4 The cell decreases in size and becomes flaccid or limp. 3 When a plant cell is immersed in a solution with lower water potential, the cell sap has a higher water potential than the solution outside the cell. 1plant cell cell sap in vacuole 33 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Figure 2.25 Cells of onion leaf epidermis (stained)Figure 2.24 Electron micrograph of stomata Figure 2.26 Effects of turgor pressure on plants Why Is Turgor Important in Plants?Turgor, or how turgid cells are, plays an important role in maintaining the shape of soft tissues in plants. The young stems and leaves of herbaceous and non-woody plants are able to remain firm and erect. This is because of the turgor pressure within their cells. When there is a high rate of water loss from the cells, they lose their turgidity and the plant wilts. The movements of certain plant parts are due to changes in turgor. For example, changes in the turgor of the guard cells cause the opening and closing of the stomata (Figure 2.24). Plasmolysis causes cells to become flaccid or limp (Figure 2.25). Cells will be killed if they remain plasmolysed for too long. Thus, it is not advisable to add too much fertiliser around the roots of plants because the soil solution will become very concentrated and water molecules will move out of the roots by\xa0osmosis. Inability of the roots to absorb water, together with continued evaporation of water from the leaves, will cause the plant to wilt. Unless sufficient water is added to dilute the soil solution, the plant will eventually die (Figure 2.26).Helpful Note Soil solution is a thin film of water that surrounds individual soil particles. It usually contains dissolved mineral salts or ions.

Link Compared to arm B, arm A contains: • More sucrose molecules per unit volume• Fewer water molecules per unit volumeAfter some time, the level of solution in arm A rises, while that in arm B falls.What do you think has happened?• Sucrose molecules cannot diffuse from arm A to B because the molecules are too big to pass through the pores of the membrane. • Water molecules move from B to A because solution B has more water molecules per unit volume than solution A. A dilute solution has more water molecules per unit volume than a concentrated solution of the same volume.Net result: Both arms A and B have the same solute concentration (same number of solute molecules per unit volume).The diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane is called osmosis. 2.2 What Is Osmosis?Learning Outcomes• Define osmosis, investigate and describe the effects of osmosis on plant and animal tissues.• Discuss the factors that affect the rate of osmosis. Figure 2.15 Experimental set-up to demonstrate osmosis OsmosisThe cell membrane is a partially permeable membrane. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. Figure 2.15 shows the two arms of a U-tube separated by a partially permeable membrane. This membrane is permeable to water molecules but not to sucrose molecules.

Observation and Discussion1What can you say about the dialysis tubing? How do you account for your observation in step 6?2What is the purpose of the second experimental set-up? Let’s Investigate 2.4 What Is Water Potential and How Is It Related to Osmosis?• The term ‘water potential’ is always used in connection with osmosis. Water potential is a measure of the tendency of water molecules to move from one place to another. A dilute solution (solution with lower concentration of solute) would have a higher water potential than a concentrated solution. Hence, water molecules would move out of the dilute solution and into the concentrated solution through osmosis.• When a partially permeable membrane separates two solutions of different water potentials, a water potential gradient is established (Figure 2.17). Water molecules move from a region with higher water potential to a region with a lower one, that is, down a water potential gradient.

It dissolves substances for chemical reactions that take place in living things. In plants, water is essential for photosynthesis, to keep cells turgid or firm, and to transport mineral salts.

It can pass through cell membranes and be absorbed into the cells.The common single sugars are glucoseand fructose (refer to Table 3.1). They both have the same chemical formula, C6H12O6, but their atoms are arranged differently within the molecules.

A scape has two main layers of cells; the outer epidermal cells and the cortical cells. Only the outer epidermal cells are covered by a waterproof cuticle that protects the plant tissue against water loss.One cut strip is placed in water and another in concentrated sucrose solution (Figure 2.28(b)). How can we show osmosis in living tissues (potato)? Potato strips are commonly used in experiments to show osmosis in living tissues. The dimensions of the strips used are shown in Figure\xa02.27. For instructions on how to set up this experiment, refer to\xa0Experiment 2C of the Practical Workbook. If the potato strips decrease in length, does this relate to water molecules leaving the strips? How can this experiment be extended to estimate the concentration of cell sap in the cell?
